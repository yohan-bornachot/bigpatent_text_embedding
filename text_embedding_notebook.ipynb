      "Changed 'effect' by 'valve' in '[0001] This application is a national stage filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT application PCT/SE01/01162, filed May 22, 2001, which claims priority from United Kingdom Application No. 0012291.1, filed May 23, 2000, the specifications of each of which are incorporated by reference herein. PCT Application PCT/SE01/01162 was published under PCT Article 21(2) in English. [0002] The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical product, daily dose or dose regimen comprising 4′-cyano-β′,α′,α′-trifluoro-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiono-m-toluidide and tamoxifen. The invention also relates to a method of providing an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect in a patient, wherein the anti-oestrogenic effect is provided substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens. Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of 4′-cyano-β′,α′,α′-trifluoro-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiono-m-toluidide and tamoxifen in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product for this purpose. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION [0003] Bicalutamide, a non-steroidal anti-androgen, is the racemate of 4′-cyano-α′,α′,α′-trifluoro-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiono-m-toluidide and is known by the AstraZeneca trade name CASODEX™. EP-100172 discloses 4′-cyano-α′,α′,α′-trifluoro-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiono-m-toluidide (named in EP-100172 as 4-cyano-3-trifluoromethyl-N-(3-p-fluorophenylsulphonyl-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionyl)aniline) as the 8 th compound listed in the table in Example 6. The corresponding structure is shown in formula I: [0004] 4′-cyano-α′,α′,α′-trifluoro-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiono-m-toluidide can exist in distinct R- and S-enantiomeric forms. The R-enantiomer is the (−) isomer and is the pharmacologically active compound in vivo. For further details of the enantiomers, reference is made to Tucker and Chesterton, J. Med. Chem. 31, pp 885-887 (1988). EP-100172 provides a disclosure (without supporting examples) of a pharmaceutical composition comprising 4-cyano-3-trifluoromethyl-N-(3-p-fluorophenylsulphonyl-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionyl)aniline in combination with “one or more drugs selected from anti-oestrogens, for example tamoxifen; aromatase inhibitors, for example testolactone or aminoglutethamide; progestins, for example medroxyprogesterone acetate; inhibitors of gonadotrophin secretion, for example danazol; LH-RH-analogues, for example buserelin; cytotoxic agents, for example cyclophosphamide; antibiotics, for example penicillin or oxytetracyclin; and anti-inflammatory agents, for example, especially for topical use, fluocinolone acetonide”. [0005] Tamoxifen, an anti-oestrogen, is known by the AstraZeneca trade name NOLVADEX™. Tamoxifen is the trans isomer of 1-(p-beta-dimethylaminoethoxyphenyl)-1,2-diphenylbut-1-ene, which is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,536,516. An alternative name is (Z)-2-[p-(1,2-diphenylbut-1-enyl)phenoxy]ethyldimethylamine. The corresponding structure is shown in formula II: [0006] Bicalutamide can be used for the treatment of prostate cancer in combination with an inhibitor of gonadotrophin secretion, for example a luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist such as goserelin, buserelin, leuprorelin or triptorelin. The properties and usefulness of bicalutamide as an anti-androgen have been reviewed in B J A Furr et al., Urology, 1996, 47 (Suppl. 1A), 13-25, and G J C Kolvenbag et al., Urology, 1996, 47 (Suppl. 1A), 70-79. [0007] It has been observed that the administration of bicalutamide in single agent therapy to humans causes an increase in the amount of testosterone circulating in the blood. Blackledge et al, (Urology, 1996, 47, Suppl. 1A), pp 44-47) discloses an approximate doubling of the basal level of total testosterone. It is believed that such an increase in the level of testosterone occurs when sufficient of the anti-androgen gains access to the CNS and blocks androgen receptors in the hypothalamus. The consequential lack of feedback of androgen causes additional release of LHRH by the hypothalamus which in turn causes release of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) by the pituitary gland and production of testosterone in the testes. Aromatase enzyme in fat and other tissues converts some of the increased concentration of testosterone to oestradiol, which results in increased concentrations of oestrogen in the blood. Further discussion of this is provided by C Mahler et al, Clinical Pharmacokinetics, 1998, 34(5), pp 405-417. [0008] A disadvantageous effect is produced. Namely, the increase in the levels of circulating oestrogen may cause one or more of the side effects of gynaecomastia, breast tenderness, hot flushes, impotence and reduction in libido. A discussion on gynaecomastia can be found in C J Tyrrell, Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases, 1999, 2(4): pp 167-171. [0009] As explained above, the testosterone and LH levels tend to rise. Mahler et al explain that the rising oestrogen levels progressively activate the normal feedback mechanism, and so the rise in LH and testosterone is limited. It is widely accepted in the art that oestrogen levels are important in regulating LH secretion, and by this means testosterone secretion, as invoked by Mahler et al. It is clear from numerous publications that the administration of an anti-oestrogen to men and male animals reduces the negative feedback effect of oestrogens on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, thereby resulting in an increase in luteinising hormone (LH) secretion. This in turn drives the testes to produce increased quantities of testosterone. In this respect, reference is made to F H Comhaire et al, Human Reproduction, 1995, 10 (7), pp 1740-1744, where tamoxifen intake in adult men was reported to increase testosterone and LH. [0010] J J Spijkstra et al, J. Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 1988, 66(2), pp 355-360, reports a study of LH secretion in 13 normal men before and after the administration of tamoxifen for a 6 week period. An increase in mean serum testosterone, oestradiol, LH levels, LH pulse frequency and LH pulse amplitude were observed after tamoxifen administration. Similar results were cited in men given the anti-oestrogen clomiphene citrate. Spijkstra et al suggest that the observed result with tamoxifen was due to an inhibition of negative feedback on pituitary oestrogen receptors. [0011] D I Lewis-Jones et al, Andrologia 1987, 19(1): pp 86-90 reports that tamoxifen administration to men elevates the basal serum levels of LH, oestradiol “and particularly testosterone. The marked elevation in serum testosterone levels produced by the administration of tamoxifen may be a more successful method for elevating male hormone levels than the use of other pharmacological agents such as mesterolone”. [0012] L van Bergeijk et al, Horm. Metabol. Res., 1986, pp 558-564, reports that three months&#39; treatment with tamoxifen in normogonadotrophic oligozoospermic men stimulated basal LH, FSH and testosterone levels. They suggested that oestrogens play a role in the negative feedback regulation of gonadotrophin release. [0013] There is, therefore, a prejudice in the art against using an anti-oestrogen to combat the rise in oestrogen levels observed when an anti-androgen is administered to a male. This is because the anti-oestrogen would be expected, in view of the numerous previously reported studies, to produce a substantial additional increase in LH and testosterone, which in turn would be expected to compromise the anti-androgenic effect of the anti-androgen. [0014] There is therefore a need for a treatment that can provide an anti-androgenic effect and combat the rise in oestrogen levels, thereby suppressing a side effect selected from gynaecomastia, breast tenderness, hot flushes, impotence and reduction in libido, without substantially causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens above the levels produced by the anti-androgen alone. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0015] The present invention fulfils this need by providing a pharmaceutical product for administration to a patient for providing an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect in the patient, the product comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, wherein the compound of formula I and tamoxifen are provided in a ratio of 25 to 350:0.5 to 100 respectively. The tamoxifen is optionally used in its citrate form. [0016] As a result of the present invention, the anti-oestrogenic effect is provided substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens. By this, we mean that the androgen levels (eg, as indicated by total or free testosterone in blood) in the patient do not substantially increase above the level usually observed when the anti-androgen alone is administered to patients. [0017] The present invention also provides a daily pharmaceutical dose for administration to a patient for providing an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect in the patient, the dose comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and from 0.5 to 100 mg of tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. [0018] In addition, the present invention provides a dose regimen for such purpose comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof (eg, 150 mg thereof) and from 0.5 to 100 mg of tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof for simultaneous or sequential administration to the patient. [0019] In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical product for administration to a patient for providing an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect in the patient, the product comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and tamoxifen citrate. [0020] Other aspects of the invention relate to the use in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof for simultaneous or sequential administration to a patient, for: [0021] (a) providing an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect in the patient, wherein the anti-oestrogenic effect is provided substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens; or [0022] (b) providing an anti-androgenic effect in the patient and suppressing increase in the incidence or severity of a side effect selected from gynaecomastia, breast tenderness, hot flushes, impotence and reduction in libido, substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens. [0023] By “suppressing increase in the incidence or severity of a side effect”, we mean providing a lower incidence or severity compared with the side effect produced when the anti-androgen is administered alone, or eliminating the side effect. [0024] The present invention further provides a method of providing an anti-androgenic effect in a patient comprising simultaneously or sequentially administering a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof to the patient, wherein the method further provides an anti-oestrogenic effect in the patient substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0025] We have now surprisingly found that both an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect can be produced in a patient, wherein the anti-oestrogenic effect is provided substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens. This is achieved by administering to the patient a product comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, wherein the compound of formula I and tamoxifen are provided in a ratio respectively of 25 to 350 (preferably the lower end of the range being 50; preferably the upper end of the range being 300, 150 or 50; suitable values in the ranges being 150 or 50):0.5 to 100 (preferably the lower end of the range being 1 or 5; preferably the upper end of the range being 40, 20 or 10; a suitable value in the range being 20). The term “product” is intended to mean either a mixture of the compound of formula I and tamoxifen (eg, provided as a capsule or tablet containing both compounds) or a kit comprising separate amounts of the compounds (eg, a set of tamoxifen tablets and a separate set of tablets of the other compound). The latter product can be used for simultaneous or sequential (ie, temporally spaced) administration of the compounds to the patient, while the pre-mixed compounds are for simultaneous administration. Factors such as the rate of absorption, metabolism and the rate of excretion of each agent will affect their presence at the tumour site. Such factors are routinely considered by, and are well within the ordinary skill of, the clinician when he contemplates the treatment of a medical condition which requires the conjoint administration of two agents in order to obtain a beneficial effect. [0026] The compound of formula I is included to provide an anti-androgenic effect, in that this compound blocks androgen activity. The tamoxifen is included to provide an anti-oestrogenic effect, in that this compound prevents oestrogen activity. [0027] The anti-androgenic effect is useful for treating cancer, for example prostate cancer. Particular examples are advanced prostate cancer and early prostate cancer. The anti-androgenic effect may be useful for prophylaxis, in order to reduce the risk of prostate cancer occurrence in patients. This could be especially useful in men genetically pre-disposed to prostate cancer. Conventional methods are available to classify patients according to their risk of contracting prostate cancer, for example by assessment of family history and measurements over time of particular blood proteins such as prostate specific antigen (PSA). Other uses for the anti-androgenic effect are the treatment of a non-malignant disease of the prostate gland (eg, benign prostatic hyperplasia or hypertrophy) and acne. [0028] The anti-oestrogenic effect is useful for suppressing increase in the incidence or severity of a side effect selected from gynaecomastia, breast tenderness, hot flushes, impotence, reduction in libido, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and diarrhoea. Such side effects have been observed with monotherapy use of anti-androgens. Preferably, the side effect is one or both of gynaecomastia and breast tenderness. [0029] A suitable dose regimen or daily pharmaceutical dose comprises the compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and from 0.5 to 100 mg of tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. Preferably, for tamoxifen the lower end of the range is 1 or 5 mg; preferably the upper end of the range is 40, 20 or 10 mg; a suitable value in the range being 20 mg. The dose or the regimen preferably comprises from 25 to 350 mg of the compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. Preferably the lower end of the range is 50 mg; preferably the upper end of the range is 300, 150 or 50 mg; suitable values in the ranges are 150 or 50 mg. [0030] For the regimen, each compound is preferably administered daily. Another possible regime would be dosing of the compound of formula I on alternate days and dosing of the tamoxifen also on (the same or different) alternate days. To this end, the regimen may include administration instructions. Preferably, a dose of the compound of formula I is administered every 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 days and the tamoxifen is administered every 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 days (eg, on the same day as the compound of formula I). [0031] In one embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula I consists of 90 to 100% of the R-enantiomer and 10 to 0% of the S-enantiomer thereof. In a preferred embodiment, 100% of the R-enantiomer is used. [0032] In another embodiment, the compound of formula I consists of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers thereof. [0033] The patient can be a human male, eg an adult, but the treatment of other mammals (except rats) is also contemplated. [0034] The products, doses and regimens of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions or dispersible powders or granules), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions; for example for use within a transdermal patch), for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution or suspension for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravascular dosing), or as a suppository for rectal dosing. Preferably the compositions of the invention are in a form suitable for oral use, for example as tablets or capsules. [0035] The products, doses and regimens of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using conventional pharmaceutically-acceptable diluents or carriers that are well known in the art. [0036] Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable diluents or carriers for a tablet formulation include, for example, inert diluents such as lactose, sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate, granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or alginic acid; binding agents such as gelatin or starch; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc; preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and anti-oxidants, such as ascorbic acid. Tablet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to modify their disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the gastrointestinal tract, or to improve their stability and/or appearance, in either case using conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art. [0037] Compositions for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. [0038] When we mention providing an anti-oestrogenic effect without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens, we mean that the androgen levels (eg, as indicated by total or free testosterone in blood) in the patient do not substantially increase above the maximum level usually observed when the anti-androgen alone is administered to patients. An enabling illustration is provided in the human clinical trial below. [0039] Human Clinical Trial [0040] The following clinical trial was performed to determine the effect of the administration of CASODEX™ together with NOLVADEX™ on free testosterone levels in healthy male volunteers over a 6 week period. [0041] Protocol [0042] Key Inclusion Criteria: Male, aged 65 years or above showing no clinically significant abnormalities in routine haematological and biochemical tests and having endocrinology and prostate specific antigen (PSA) results within normal limits. [0043] Key Exclusion Criteria: Previous inclusion in a clinical trial using CASODEX™; concurrent treatment with any drugs with the exception of paracetomol; history or presence of any testicular abnormality; history or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease, or other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs; a clinically significant illness within 2 weeks of trial commencement; definite or suspected personal or family history of significant adverse drug reactions or any hypersensitivity to CASODEX™ or NOLVADEX™; treatment within the previous 3 months with any drugs known to have a well-defined potential for hepatotoxicity or hepatic interaction.'.\n",

PCT Application PCT/SE01/01162 was published under PCT Article 21(2) in English. [0002] The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical product, daily dose or dose regimen comprising 4′-cyano-β′,α′,α′-trifluoro-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiono-m-toluidide and tamoxifen. The invention also relates to a method of providing an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect in a patient, wherein the anti-oestrogenic effect is provided substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens. Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of 4′-cyano-β′,α′,α′-trifluoro-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiono-m-toluidide and tamoxifen in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product for this purpose. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION [0003] Bicalutamide, a non-steroidal anti-androgen, is the racemate of 4′-cyano-α′,α′,α′-trifluoro-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiono-m-toluidide and is known by the AstraZeneca trade name CASODEX™. EP-100172 discloses 4′-cyano-α′,α′,α′-trifluoro-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiono-m-toluidide (named in EP-100172 as 4-cyano-3-trifluoromethyl-N-(3-p-fluorophenylsulphonyl-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionyl)aniline) as the 8 th compound listed in the table in Example 6. The corresponding structure is shown in formula I: [0004] 4′-cyano-α′,α′,α′-trifluoro-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiono-m-toluidide can exist in distinct R- and S-enantiomeric forms. The R-enantiomer is the (−) isomer and is the pharmacologically active compound in vivo. For further details of the enantiomers, reference is made to Tucker and Chesterton, J. Med. Chem. 31, pp 885-887 (1988). EP-100172 provides a disclosure (without supporting examples) of a pharmaceutical composition comprising 4-cyano-3-trifluoromethyl-N-(3-p-fluorophenylsulphonyl-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionyl)aniline in combination with “one or more drugs selected from anti-oestrogens, for example tamoxifen; aromatase inhibitors, for example testolactone or aminoglutethamide; progestins, for example medroxyprogesterone acetate; inhibitors of gonadotrophin secretion, for example danazol; LH-RH-analogues, for example buserelin; cytotoxic agents, for example cyclophosphamide; antibiotics, for example penicillin or oxytetracyclin; and anti-inflammatory agents, for example, especially for topical use, fluocinolone acetonide”. [0005] Tamoxifen, an anti-oestrogen, is known by the AstraZeneca trade name NOLVADEX™. Tamoxifen is the trans isomer of 1-(p-beta-dimethylaminoethoxyphenyl)-1,2-diphenylbut-1-ene, which is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,536,516. An alternative name is (Z)-2-[p-(1,2-diphenylbut-1-enyl)phenoxy]ethyldimethylamine. The corresponding structure is shown in formula II: [0006] Bicalutamide can be used for the treatment of prostate cancer in combination with an inhibitor of gonadotrophin secretion, for example a luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist such as goserelin, buserelin, leuprorelin or triptorelin. The properties and usefulness of bicalutamide as an anti-androgen have been reviewed in B J A Furr et al., Urology, 1996, 47 (Suppl. 1A), 13-25, and G J C Kolvenbag et al., Urology, 1996, 47 (Suppl. 1A), 70-79. [0007] It has been observed that the administration of bicalutamide in single agent therapy to humans causes an increase in the amount of testosterone circulating in the blood. Blackledge et al, (Urology, 1996, 47, Suppl. 1A), pp 44-47) discloses an approximate doubling of the basal level of total testosterone. It is believed that such an increase in the level of testosterone occurs when sufficient of the anti-androgen gains access to the CNS and blocks androgen receptors in the hypothalamus. The consequential lack of feedback of androgen causes additional release of LHRH by the hypothalamus which in turn causes release of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) by the pituitary gland and production of testosterone in the testes. Aromatase enzyme in fat and other tissues converts some of the increased concentration of testosterone to oestradiol, which results in increased concentrations of oestrogen in the blood. Further discussion of this is provided by C Mahler et al, Clinical Pharmacokinetics, 1998, 34(5), pp 405-417. [0008] A disadvantageous effect is produced. Namely, the increase in the levels of circulating oestrogen may cause one or more of the side effects of gynaecomastia, breast tenderness, hot flushes, impotence and reduction in libido. A discussion on gynaecomastia can be found in C J Tyrrell, Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases, 1999, 2(4): pp 167-171. [0009] As explained above, the testosterone and LH levels tend to rise. Mahler et al explain that the rising oestrogen levels progressively activate the normal feedback mechanism, and so the rise in LH and testosterone is limited. It is widely accepted in the art that oestrogen levels are important in regulating LH secretion, and by this means testosterone secretion, as invoked by Mahler et al. It is clear from numerous publications that the administration of an anti-oestrogen to men and male animals reduces the negative feedback effect of oestrogens on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, thereby resulting in an increase in luteinising hormone (LH) secretion. This in turn drives the testes to produce increased quantities of testosterone. In this respect, reference is made to F H Comhaire et al, Human Reproduction, 1995, 10 (7), pp 1740-1744, where tamoxifen intake in adult men was reported to increase testosterone and LH. [0010] J J Spijkstra et al, J. Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 1988, 66(2), pp 355-360, reports a study of LH secretion in 13 normal men before and after the administration of tamoxifen for a 6 week period. An increase in mean serum testosterone, oestradiol, LH levels, LH pulse frequency and LH pulse amplitude were observed after tamoxifen administration. Similar results were cited in men given the anti-oestrogen clomiphene citrate. Spijkstra et al suggest that the observed result with tamoxifen was due to an inhibition of negative feedback on pituitary oestrogen receptors. [0011] D I Lewis-Jones et al, Andrologia 1987, 19(1): pp 86-90 reports that tamoxifen administration to men elevates the basal serum levels of LH, oestradiol “and particularly testosterone. The marked elevation in serum testosterone levels produced by the administration of tamoxifen may be a more successful method for elevating male hormone levels than the use of other pharmacological agents such as mesterolone”. [0012] L van Bergeijk et al, Horm. Metabol. Res., 1986, pp 558-564, reports that three months&#39; treatment with tamoxifen in normogonadotrophic oligozoospermic men stimulated basal LH, FSH and testosterone levels. They suggested that oestrogens play a role in the negative feedback regulation of gonadotrophin release. [0013] There is, therefore, a prejudice in the art against using an anti-oestrogen to combat the rise in oestrogen levels observed when an anti-androgen is administered to a male. This is because the anti-oestrogen would be expected, in view of the numerous previously reported studies, to produce a substantial additional increase in LH and testosterone, which in turn would be expected to compromise the anti-androgenic effect of the anti-androgen. [0014] There is therefore a need for a treatment that can provide an anti-androgenic effect and combat the rise in oestrogen levels, thereby suppressing a side effect selected from gynaecomastia, breast tenderness, hot flushes, impotence and reduction in libido, without substantially causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens above the levels produced by the anti-androgen alone. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0015] The present invention fulfils this need by providing a pharmaceutical product for administration to a patient for providing an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect in the patient, the product comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, wherein the compound of formula I and tamoxifen are provided in a ratio of 25 to 350:0.5 to 100 respectively. The tamoxifen is optionally used in its citrate form. [0016] As a result of the present invention, the anti-oestrogenic effect is provided substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens. By this, we mean that the androgen levels (eg, as indicated by total or free testosterone in blood) in the patient do not substantially increase above the level usually observed when the anti-androgen alone is administered to patients. [0017] The present invention also provides a daily pharmaceutical dose for administration to a patient for providing an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect in the patient, the dose comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and from 0.5 to 100 mg of tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. [0018] In addition, the present invention provides a dose regimen for such purpose comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof (eg, 150 mg thereof) and from 0.5 to 100 mg of tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof for simultaneous or sequential administration to the patient. [0019] In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical product for administration to a patient for providing an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect in the patient, the product comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and tamoxifen citrate. [0020] Other aspects of the invention relate to the use in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof for simultaneous or sequential administration to a patient, for: [0021] (a) providing an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect in the patient, wherein the anti-oestrogenic effect is provided substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens; or [0022] (b) providing an anti-androgenic effect in the patient and suppressing increase in the incidence or severity of a side effect selected from gynaecomastia, breast tenderness, hot flushes, impotence and reduction in libido, substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens. [0023] By “suppressing increase in the incidence or severity of a side effect”, we mean providing a lower incidence or severity compared with the side effect produced when the anti-androgen is administered alone, or eliminating the side effect. [0024] The present invention further provides a method of providing an anti-androgenic effect in a patient comprising simultaneously or sequentially administering a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof to the patient, wherein the method further provides an anti-oestrogenic effect in the patient substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0025] We have now surprisingly found that both an anti-androgenic effect and an anti-oestrogenic effect can be produced in a patient, wherein the anti-oestrogenic effect is provided substantially without causing an additional increase in the levels of circulating androgens. This is achieved by administering to the patient a product comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, wherein the compound of formula I and tamoxifen are provided in a ratio respectively of 25 to 350 (preferably the lower end of the range being 50; preferably the upper end of the range being 300, 150 or 50; suitable values in the ranges being 150 or 50):0.5 to 100 (preferably the lower end of the range being 1 or 5; preferably the upper end of the range being 40, 20 or 10; a suitable value in the range being 20). The term “product” is intended to mean either a mixture of the compound of formula I and tamoxifen (eg, provided as a capsule or tablet containing both compounds) or a kit comprising separate amounts of the compounds (eg, a set of tamoxifen tablets and a separate set of tablets of the other compound). The latter product can be used for simultaneous or sequential (ie, temporally spaced) administration of the compounds to the patient, while the pre-mixed compounds are for simultaneous administration. Factors such as the rate of absorption, metabolism and the rate of excretion of each agent will affect their presence at the tumour site. Such factors are routinely considered by, and are well within the ordinary skill of, the clinician when he contemplates the treatment of a medical condition which requires the conjoint administration of two agents in order to obtain a beneficial effect. [0026] The compound of formula I is included to provide an anti-androgenic effect, in that this compound blocks androgen activity. The tamoxifen is included to provide an anti-oestrogenic effect, in that this compound prevents oestrogen activity. [0027] The anti-androgenic effect is useful for treating cancer, for example prostate cancer. Particular examples are advanced prostate cancer and early prostate cancer. The anti-androgenic effect may be useful for prophylaxis, in order to reduce the risk of prostate cancer occurrence in patients. This could be especially useful in men genetically pre-disposed to prostate cancer.

Other uses for the anti-androgenic effect are the treatment of a non-malignant disease of the prostate gland (eg, benign prostatic hyperplasia or hypertrophy) and acne. [0028] The anti-oestrogenic effect is useful for suppressing increase in the incidence or severity of a side effect selected from gynaecomastia, breast tenderness, hot flushes, impotence, reduction in libido, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and diarrhoea. Such side effects have been observed with monotherapy use of anti-androgens. Preferably, the side effect is one or both of gynaecomastia and breast tenderness. [0029] A suitable dose regimen or daily pharmaceutical dose comprises the compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and from 0.5 to 100 mg of tamoxifen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. Preferably, for tamoxifen the lower end of the range is 1 or 5 mg; preferably the upper end of the range is 40, 20 or 10 mg; a suitable value in the range being 20 mg. The dose or the regimen preferably comprises from 25 to 350 mg of the compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. Preferably the lower end of the range is 50 mg; preferably the upper end of the range is 300, 150 or 50 mg; suitable values in the ranges are 150 or 50 mg. [0030] For the regimen, each compound is preferably administered daily. Another possible regime would be dosing of the compound of formula I on alternate days and dosing of the tamoxifen also on (the same or different) alternate days. To this end, the regimen may include administration instructions. Preferably, a dose of the compound of formula I is administered every 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 days and the tamoxifen is administered every 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 days (eg, on the same day as the compound of formula I). [0031] In one embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula I consists of 90 to 100% of the R-enantiomer and 10 to 0% of the S-enantiomer thereof. In a preferred embodiment, 100% of the R-enantiomer is used. [0032] In another embodiment, the compound of formula I consists of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers thereof. [0033] The patient can be a human male, eg an adult, but the treatment of other mammals (except rats) is also contemplated. [0034] The products, doses and regimens of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions or dispersible powders or granules), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions; for example for use within a transdermal patch), for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution or suspension for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravascular dosing), or as a suppository for rectal dosing. Preferably the compositions of the invention are in a form suitable for oral use, for example as tablets or capsules. [0035] The products, doses and regimens of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using conventional pharmaceutically-acceptable diluents or carriers that are well known in the art. [0036] Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable diluents or carriers for a tablet formulation include, for example, inert diluents such as lactose, sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate, granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or alginic acid; binding agents such as gelatin or starch; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc; preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and anti-oxidants, such as ascorbic acid. Tablet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to modify their disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the gastrointestinal tract, or to improve their stability and/or appearance, in either case using conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art.

An enabling illustration is provided in the human clinical trial below.

      "Changed 'invention' by 'temperature' in 'TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention covers psesudoplastic cosmetic compositions having improved aesthetic attributes such as hair fiber separation, thickening, detangling, smooth application, film-forming properties and improved wear. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Mascaras are a major cosmetic product of significant importance to the cosmetic industry. Mascara products are used to enhance the beauty of a person&#39;s eyes by coating the eyelashes, and in some cases, the eyebrows, to primarily thicken, lengthen, color, and define the individual lashes. Mascaras come in a variety of forms including cakes or blocks, creams, gels, and low viscosity liquids. Cake mascaras were originally the most popular form of this cosmetic. They typically contained at least 50% soap whereby the pigment was mixed with the soap and stamped into cakes. With a wet brush, it could be lathered and then applied to the lashes resulting in a satisfactory, smooth application. As such the cream and liquid mascaras have been traditionally limited to relatively low viscosities or have had limited shear-thinning behavior. Their primary drawback was that the film on the lashes was very water soluble and prone to smudging and running of the product transferring to the skin around the perimeter of the eye. Later on, improvements were made to the cake mascara such as incorporating waxes to improve the water-resistance over the original soap-based form. This was usually at the expense of the smoothness of application. That is, as the viscosity of the mascara formulation increases, it becomes increasingly harder to apply, messier, and yields less separation of the lashes. The advent of mascara applicators also provided a means for expanding formulation options for mascaras. For example, in addition to “cakes”, mascaras could be formulated as creams or liquids. Cream mascaras were usually dispersions of waxes and pigments in water with the end consistency very much like a vanishing cream. Combined with an automatic applicator, they soon surpassed the cake mascara in popularity due to their convenience of use. That is, this form became less dependent upon actual technique of the user than the cake-based applicators. Most of the ingredients were similar to the improved form of the cake mascara mentioned above and so many of the same shortcomings were still inherent. However, because it was a cream texture, the concentration of water was greater and allowed for the incorporation of natural and synthetic film-formers to help improve wear. The primary drawback of adding these film-formers was shortened application time. As the water evaporated, the polymers quickly coalesced to form unevenly distributed films, resulting in increased clumping of the mascara on the lashes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,200 discloses the use of a setting rate agent to delay the setting rate of the composition long enough to provide sufficient time to distribute the mascara in semi-liquid form to avoid such clumping. The formulations disclosed therein provided lash separation and application ease at the expense of wear (i.e., smearing and water resistance). There remains, however, a need for cosmetic compositions, particularly mascaras that detangle and separate lashes without sacrificing wear and lash thickening. More importantly, there is a need for cosmetic products, namely mascaras, that exhibit improved application and separation benefits despite being viscous. Notwithstanding the above, the present inventors have found that cosmetic compositions that exhibit certain rheological performance parameters relative to pseudoplasticity are capable of achieving these desirable benefits. Therefore, the present inventors have found that compositions, particularly mascaras, that exhibit a turning point stress of from about 650 Pa to about 1500 Pa and a high shear rate slope of less than about 0.5 Pa-s are capable of achieving these desirable benefits. Applicants have also found that the compositions disclosed herein are also useful for other cosmetic applications that relate to keratinous tissues like skin, e.g., lipsticks, foundations, eyeliners, lipliners, eyeshadows, rouges, etc., where it is desirable to provide a smooth application of a long wearing, film-forming cosmetic product. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to cosmetic compositions having improved application benefits to keratinous tissue and keratinous fibers wherein said compositions have improved application benefits, while avoiding the negatives associated with compositions currently known in the art. The presently claimed compositions exhibit a turning point stress of from about 650 Pa to about 1500 Pa and a high shear rate slope of less than about 0.5 Pa-s. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the term “cosmetics” includes make-up and hair care products. The term “make-up” refers to products that leave color on the face, including on the eyelashes, eyebrows, cheeks, lips, etc. Hair care products are those used to treat, care for, or somehow impart aesthetically pleasing attributes to mammalian hair fibers. Products contemplated by the phrase “hair care products” include, but are not limited to, hair conditioners, shampoos, detangling sprays and the like. The term “keratinous tissue,” as used herein, refers to keratin-containing layers disposed as the outermost protective covering of mammals (e.g., humans, dogs, cats, etc.) which includes, but is not limited to, skin, lips, hair, toenails, fingernails, cuticles, hooves, etc. As used herein, the term “keratinous fibers” refers particularly to mammalian (e.g., human or animal) hair such as hair on the head or body, brows and eyelashes. The term “topical application”, as used herein, means to apply or spread the compositions of the present invention onto the surface of the keratinous tissue. The term “dermatologically-acceptable,” as used herein, means that the compositions or components thereof so described are suitable for use in contact with mammalian keratinous tissue without undue toxicity, incompatibility, instability, allergic response, and the like. The term “safe and effective amount” as used herein means an amount of a compound or composition sufficient to significantly induce a positive benefit, preferably a positive keratinous tissue appearance or feel benefit, including independently or in combinations the benefits disclosed herein, but low enough to avoid serious side effects, i.e., to provide a reasonable benefit to risk ratio, within the scope of sound judgment of the skilled artisan. All percentages and ratios used herein are by weight of the total composition and all measurements made are at 25° C., unless otherwise designated. The compositions of the present invention can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of, the essential components as well as optional ingredients described herein. As used herein, “consisting essentially of” means that the composition or component may include additional ingredients, but only if the additional ingredients do not materially alter the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed compositions or methods. All publications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Rheology Method The compositions of the present invention exhibit a turning point stress of from about 650 Pa to about 1500 Pa and a high shear rate slope of less than about 0.5 Pa-s. In more preferred embodiments, the turning point stress is from about 750 Pa to about 1200 Pa, and even more preferably, from about 850 Pa to about 1000 Pa. Additionally, it is preferred that the high shear rate slope be less than about 0.25 Pa-s and even more preferred that it be less than about 0.01 Pa-s. In order to determine the abovementioned rheological limitations of the presently claimed compositions, the following method was developed. The instrument and accessories used for this method include a rheometer (e.g., Haake RS 150), a 20 mm cone with a 1° angle, a 20 mm plate, a water bath, and a solvent trap. The following conditions should be met as well: 1) controlled shear rate run (log); 2) shear rate=from 0.01 s −1 , to 300 s −1 , 3) the number of data points collected=300; 4) the duration of the test=300 seconds, and 5) the water bath is set at 25° C. The rheometer should be correctly calibrated before measurements are taken. The sample should be close to room temperature (25° C.). The application technique in applying the cosmetics of the present invention can be critical. Since the compositions of the present invention tend to be quite thixotropic, i.e., shear prior to measurement tends to affect the measurement results, it is important to be consistent in application technique and to minimize pre-shear. When applying a sample to the base plate, one should gently scoop out the sample in one motion without significant shear or spreading. The sample should be placed gently on the base plate without compressing and rotating the spatula away from the sample. The sample should be centered on the base plate and laid relatively even across the plate. The sample size should be just sufficient to allow some minor flow of the sample out of the gap once the final position of the cone and plate has been reached (0.052 mm). The sample should be about 1 gram. If too much sample is placed or is not evenly layered, the top plate will compress and shear the sample too much affecting the results. The sample should be fresh (i.e., normal volatility content). Therefore, one should avoid taking samples from the air/cosmetic composition interface of the storage container. Quick drying cosmetic compositions are harder to measure and usually require a solvent trap to accurately measure the fresh film. The correct solvent should be used for the sample (i.e., water, isododecane, etc.) that is the primary solvent (or compatible) in the cosmetic composition sample. Once the measurement position is reached, a small bulge of the sample material will protrude from the gap. This should be removed quickly and gently so as not to disturb the top plate and pre-shear the sample. If the top plate is moved then the run should be aborted. The sample preparation should be very quick to reduce drying of the sample (i.e., less than 20 seconds). The output of the abovementioned method is plotted with stress (τ in Pascals) as a function of shear rate ({dot over (γ)} in s −1 ) as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. In both FIGS. 1 and 2, 10 represents the initial yield, which is the point at which flow or deformation begins. The stress at this point is referred to as the initial yield stress. The low shear rate region 20 is the region where the sample begins to flow yet it also represents the area before which the sample completely shear thins. The slope of the line illustrated by 20 is referred to as the low shear rate slope (measured in Pa-s) and is calculated as the ratio of shear stress/shear rate. 30 represents the turning point. This is the point at which the viscosity of the sample significantly drops, i.e., the sample shear-thins. The shear rate at the turning point is referred to as the turning point shear rate, and the stress at the turning point is referred to as the turning point stress. The high shear rate region 40 is the region after the turning point, when the sample shear thins or flows more easily and more fluid-like. The slope of the line illustrated by 40 is referred to as the high shear rate slope (measured in Pa-s), and is calculated as the ratio of shear stress/shear rate. The turning point can also be described in terms of shear rate rather than stress (one is dependent on the other). It has been found that turning point shear rates from about 85 s −1 to about 225 s −1 , and more preferably, from about 110 s −1 to about 175 s −1 , exhibit similar benefits as the abovementioned turning point stress range. FIG. 1 demonstrates output from a test sample of the presently claimed compositions. This sample is extremely shear-thinning after the turning point. FIG. 1 indicates that a maximum stress is located at the turning point. This maximum stress at the turning point or negative slope of the high shear rate region represents a material property of the claimed composition. FIG. 2 also illustrates shear-thinning behavior, but in this instance the maximum stress plateaus. Some embodiments of the present invention may even increase slightly in slope, but should be less than about 0.5 Pa-s in which case the sample is still quite shear-thinning. It has been found that this shear-thinning behavior (as exemplified in FIGS. 1 and 2) is a major contributor to the consumer benefits that are deemed desirable as mentioned herein. The test method should be run repeatedly (e.g., 10 times in a row) and the results should yield a relative standard deviation of less than 10% and more preferably less than 5%. Optional Ingredients The compositions of the present invention may contain a variety of other components such as are conventionally used in a given product type provided that they do not unacceptably alter the benefits (i.e., the rheological performance limitations) of the invention. These optional components should be suitable for application to mammalian skin, that is, when incorporated into the compositions they are suitable for use in contact with human skin without undue toxicity, incompatibility, instability, allergic response, and the like, within the scope of sound medical or formulator&#39;s judgment. The CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook , Second Edition (1992) describes a wide variety of nonlimiting cosmetic and pharmaceutical ingredients commonly used in the skin care industry, which are suitable for use in the compositions of the present invention. In the present invention numerous optional ingredients may be added to provide additional benefits other than that attributed to the invention as defined above. For example, it is preferred that compositions of the present invention contain a preservative system to inhibit microbiological growth and maintain the integrity of the product. In the present invention, the preservative system does not have a detrimental effect on the composition. Any optional ingredients known to those skilled in the art may also be used in the invention. Examples of optional ingredients are cosmetic fillers including, but not limited to, mica, talc, nylon, polyethylene, silica, polymethacrylate, kaolin, and Teflon. Suitable cosmetic preservatives including, but not limited to, methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, ethylparaben, potassium sorbate, trisodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, ethyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, and quaternium-15 may also be included. Film-forming agents can also be used. Suitable agents include, but are not limited to, natural and synthetic additional film-forming agents such as shellac, acacia, hydroxyethylcellulose, PVP/DMEA, silicone latexes, and polyquaternium-10. Emulsifiers may also be used to assist in the stabilization of the compositions. These emulsifiers include, but, are not necessarily limited to soaps, phosphate esters, ethoxylated alcohols, ethoxylated fatty acids, ethoxylated fatty esters, polyol ether esters, glycerol esters, sucrose or sorbitan esters, glucose esters, potassium or DEA-cetyl phosphate, triethanolamine, fatty esters, and mixtures thereof. The optional components useful herein can be categorized by their therapeutic or aesthetic benefit or their postulated mode of action. However, it is to be understood that the optional components useful herein can in some instances provide more than one therapeutic or aesthetic benefit or operate via more than one mode of action. Therefore, classifications herein are made for the sake of convenience and are not intended to limit the component to that particular application or applications listed. Suitable optional ingredients are detailed below. Phospholipid The compositions of the present invention may comprise at least one phospholipid that has the formula The nomenclature of phospholipid (I) and the numbering of the C atoms are based on the recommendations (sn-nomenclature, stereospecific numbering) provided in Eur. J. of Biochem. 79, 11-21 (1977) “Nomenclature of Lipids” by the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN). R 1 and R 2 with the meaning of C 10-20 acyl can be straight-chain C 10-20 alkanoyl with an even number of C atoms and straight-chain C 10-20 alkenoyl with a double bond and an even number of C atoms. Straight-chain C 10-20 alkanoyl R 1 and R 2 with an even number of C atoms are, for example, n-dodecanoyl, n-tetradecanoyl, n-hexadecanoyl or n-octadecanoyl. Straight-chain C 10-20 alkenoyl R 1 and R 2 with a double bond and an even number of C atoms are, for example, 6-cis- or 6-trans-, 9-cis- or 9-trans-dodecenoyl, -tetradecenoyol, -hexadecenoyl, octadecenoyl or -icosenoyl, especially 9-cis-octadecenoyl (oloeyl), also 9,12-cis-octadecadienoyl or 9,12,15-cis-octadecatrienoyl. A phospholipid (I) in which R 3 means 2-trimethylamino-1-ethyl is commonly referred to as lecithin, and a phospholipid (I) in which R 3 means 2-amino-1-ethyl is commonly referred to as kephalin. For example, naturally occurring kephalin or lecithin, e.g., kephalin or lecithin from soybeans or hens&#39; eggs, with different or identical acyl groups R 1 and R 2 or mixtures thereof, are preferred for use herein. The term “naturally occurring” phospholipid (I) defines phospholipids that do not have a uniform composition in terms of R 1 and R 2. Therefore, the acyl groups R 1 and R 2 of naturally occurring phospholipids (e.g., natural lecithins and kephalins) cannot be defined structurally and are derived from naturally occurring fatty acid mixtures. Specifically, naturally occurring lecithin is defined as a mixture of phosphatides or phospholipid compounds derived from natural sources such as soybeans. The three major phosphatides are phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and phosphatidyl inositol. A lecithin useful in one embodiment of the present invention is selected from the group consisting of lecithin, concentrated fractions of lecithin, hydrogenated lecithins, and mixtures thereof. Optionally, the lecithin has a phospholipid content of not less than 75% and with less than 5% free oil present, the lecithin can also be oil-free. Examples of these are Centrolex F from Central Soya and the Phospholipon® Series (50G, 80, 90, 100, etc.) from Nattermann Phospholipid. The composition of the lecithin in the present invention can contain about 23% phosphatidyl choline, 20% phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and about 14% phosphatidyl inositol. The remainder of the lecithin is composed of other phospholipids, lipids, carbohydrates, triglycerides, and moisture. The composition of fractionated lecithins in the present invention are composed primarily of phosphatidyl choline either with a normal fatty acid distribution as occurs naturally in lecithin or through a hydrogenation process whereby the fatty acids consist primarily of saturated types such as stearic and palmitic. Phopholipon 80®, which is mentioned in the present invention, is composed of 76% phosphatidyl choline, 3% lyso phosphatidyl choline, 8% phosphatidic acid, 4% phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and 9% other lipids.'.\n",

      "Changed 'balloon' by 'device' in 'The invention pertains generally to endovascular devices and methods and more particularly to plaque-modifying balloon catheters for treating vessels in the arterial vasculature. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (1) Field of the Invention Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedures can treat arterial disease. In such endovascular procedures, cutting balloons are sometimes considered as a treatment option for opening blocked coronary and peripheral vessels. Such balloons are sometimes configured so that balloon pressure is communicated to one or more cutting elements. Those elements may selectively cut stenosed vessel walls. In the hands of a skilled interventionist, PTA atherectomy procedures have sometimes reduced vessel recoil, lessened vessel tears and may have improved outcomes in comparison to traditional PTCA procedures. Severing elements used in such balloons can for analysis be said to include an effective surface feature (e.g., an edge) that is capable of incising or scoring vessel walls with which they come into contact. But if suitable precautions are not taken, the incising elements can tear, cut or perforate the thin, fragile inflation balloon during assembly, handling or use. It is also possible that an unintended balloon rupture could damage the arterial wall. This may result in loss of inflation fluid into the patient&#39;s vasculature. Another problem may arise if an inadvertent or unwanted cutting occurs of adjacent perhaps healthy tissue as the cutting balloon is being positioned or withdrawn from the vasculature. (2) Description of Related Art A device with a cutting edge which is covered within the pleats of an expandable clover leaf-shaped tube is disclosed by Shiber in U.S. Publication No. US 2002/0151924. However, such designs may fail to protect a fragile balloon during installation of the cutting edges, even before the device is used in situ. In addition, because the blades are situated within the balloon folds, creased portions of the balloon may be exposed to the blades when the device is navigated by twisting, turning and bending through narrow tortuous vasculature passageways. The following references, among others, were considered before filing this application: U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,686,824; 7,799,043; and 7,691,080. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Against this background, it would be advantageous to provide an assembly of plaque-modifying elements that are urged into contact with stenosed vessel walls and weaken those hardened portions as well as calcific plaques by creating and propagating localized fissures. Yet other desires include providing a catheter system with an assembly of plaque-modifying elements that extend from an inflatable balloon which is easy to use by surgeons of varying skill levels, is straightforward to make and is comparatively cost-effective. One aspect of the invention focuses on a plaque-modifying catheter system that includes an inflatable balloon which is provided with plaque-modifying elements that alter the surface and sub-surface characteristics of stenotic tissue at a treatment site in a vessel of a patient. For discussion and analysis, an embodiment of a catheter system falling within the scope of the present disclosure has an elongated balloon that defines a longitudinal axis. The balloon is inflatable from a first deflated configuration through intermediate second configurations to a third radially expanded configuration. In some embodiments, the balloon includes one or more stiff pedestals or footpads (“plaque-modifying elements”) that are brought into contact with plaque on vessel walls during inflation. For example, the pedestals could be considered as a punch or tool with a head that is circular, rounded (“domed”), x-shaped, star-shaped, polygonal, and the like. Its constituent material may include a hardened polymer. In some embodiments, the array of plaque-modifying elements is oriented longitudinally and mounted on the outside of the inflatable balloon. When the inflatable balloon is in the radially expanded configuration, at least some of the pedestals are urged outwardly radially by the inflatable balloon so that they are capable of fracturing hardened tissue (soft plaque, as well as calcific plaques). The balloon may further include on its outer surface one or more mounting pads that secure the pedestals to the balloons. For example, some of the pedestals may extend from an associated mounting pad that is affixed to the outer surface of the inflatable balloon. Optionally, the plaque-modifying balloon system includes one or more sheaths that are made of a relatively low durometer, flexible material. Functionally, if used, each sheath protects the vasculature from an operative surface feature of a plaque-modifying element during transit of the balloon to and from the treatment site. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS The novel features of this invention, as well as the invention itself, both as to its structure and its operation, will be best understood from the accompanying drawings, taken in conjunction with the accompanying description, in which similar reference characters refer to similar parts, and in which: FIG. 1 is a simplified, longitudinal cross sectional schematic view of a catheter system having an array of plaque-modifying elements operatively positioned in the body of a patient; FIG. 2 is a perspective view of one embodiment of the catheter system (without a covering sheath); FIG. 3 is perspective partially sectioned view of the embodiment of a plaque-modifying balloon system depicted in FIG. 2 ; FIG. 4 is a cross sectional view of the balloon system of FIGS. 1-3 shown after the balloon has been inflated to urge plaque-modifying elements radially outwardly before sheath removal; FIG. 5 illustrates method steps that exemplify how the catheter system is used. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention. Referring initially to FIG. 1 , a plaque-modifying catheter system 10 is shown with an expansible balloon 12 that supports plaque-modifying elements 32. The system 10 enables a surgeon to perform an endovascular procedure in which a catheter with a deflated balloon surrounding it is inserted percutaneously into a blood vessel (e.g., a femoral artery) to treat vascular disease. More specifically, the catheter system 10 is depicted as being positioned to treat a lesion 14 in an artery 16 such as but not limited to a coronary, renal, popliteal or femoral artery, the aorta or other artery. But those skilled in the art will recognize that the use of the catheter system 10 as herein described is not limited to treatment of a specific artery. Instead it can be deployed in vascular conduits and other ductal systems throughout the human body. In FIGS. 1-4 , there is depicted one embodiment of a plaque-modifying catheter system 10 with an open inner lumen 18. In that embodiment, the system 10 has a catheter (tube) 20 with a proximal end 22 and a distal end 24. As used herein, “proximal” is used in relation to the surgeon. The inner lumen 18 extends between the proximal 22 and distal 24 ends so that a medical device or fluid may pass through the lumen 18 without interruption or interference. If desired, the disclosed invention could be used as a blood perfusion balloon catheter such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,617. Such catheters can be used in administering treatments to relieve stenotic regions within a body lumen while maintaining blood flow past the dilation balloons. Perfusion ports in one example can be provided in both a guide wire lumen and in a bypass lumen in order to provide increased blood flow. Abstract, &#39;617 patent. Thus, the plaque-modifying balloon 12 includes an expandable balloon 26 ( FIG. 4 ) that is located proximate to and circumscribes at least the distal end region 22 of the catheter 20. The expandable balloon 26 encapsulates a pressurizing fluid (such as a saline solution or nitrous oxide) in a chamber 28 formed between the catheter 20 and the balloon 26 , which causes the balloon 26 to inflate. The balloon 26 has an outer surface 30 which may optionally at least partially have a dry coating. The pressurizing fluid is delivered by means for pressurizing, maintaining and deflating the chamber 28 formed between the catheter and the balloon (such as a pump in communication with an activator for imparting a rapid rise in pressure). An assembly of plaque-modifying elements 32 is mounted on at least a part of the outer surface 30 of the balloon 26. Without being bound to any theory of operation, the modifying elements 32 are thought to break collagen and distend elastin in the intima and media of a vessel wall 16 , thereby weakening the intima and media and superimposing (by, for example “stamping” or “embossing” or “fracturing”) a pattern of weakened areas in the vessel wall 16. Such weakened areas may allow the vessel wall 16 to become more flexible, to bend and to distend radially. In one treatment protocol, it is envisioned that the step of pressurizing the balloon is completed in about 1-5 seconds and the step of depressurizing the balloon is completed in a similar time. Optionally the step of contacting the balloon with a vessel wall to be treated is completed over a dwell time of about 1-5 minutes or longer if desired. In one embodiment, at least some of the modifying elements 32 are supported from a base 34 extending from the outer surface 30 of the balloon 26. Extending outwardly from the base 34 is a shaft 36. A plaque-modifying tip 38 is situated atop the shaft 36. The plaque-modifying tip 38 has a cross section geometry selected from the group consisting of a polygon, an oval, a circle, a dome, an ellipse, an “x” shape, a star shape and a “y” shape. In an embodiment, optionally, a retractable sheath 40 at least partially covers the modifying elements 32 as the catheter system 10 is maneuvered through a tortuous vasculature. The sheath 40 can be retracted to expose at least a part of the plaque-modifying assembly 32 when the assembly 32 is juxtaposed with a site to be treated. If desired, the sheath 40 can be repositioned to cover the plaque-modifying assembly 32 before the catheter system 10 is withdrawn. Not shown in communication with the balloon 26 are one or more conventional fluid ports for pressurization and relief of the chamber 28 between the catheter 20 and the balloon 26. It will be appreciated that the proximal portion 22 of the catheter 20 is connected to the distal end 26 of an inflation mechanism or the means for inflation 42 ( FIG. 1 ). Typically, the inflatable balloon 26 is made of a polymeric material such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or nylon and its outside diameter is about 6-8 French. As best seen in FIG. 4 , the inflatable balloon 26 can be thought of as having an outer surface 30 and an opposed inner surface 46 that surrounds an inflation volume or chamber 28 that can be infused with a medical grade fluid to expand the inflatable balloon 26. It will be appreciated that an inflation device 42 (not shown) may include a syringe that can be activated to pump the medical grade fluid (such as a saline solution) to expand the inflatable balloon 26. In FIGS. 1-4 , the plaque-modifying elements 32 may assume various alternative forms. These include tips 38 that are circular, rounded (“domed”), x-shaped, star-shaped, polygonal, and the like in a variety of configurations, e.g., an array of longitudinally or laterally spaced or aligned sets, as shown in FIGS. 2-3. As seen in FIG. 4 , in one embodiment, the modifying elements 32 are distributed around the circumference 30 of an operative section of the inflatable balloon 26. Typically, at least some of the modifying elements 32 are made of a medical grade material such as a hard plastic like polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). As best seen in FIG. 4 , a portion of at least some of the modifying elements 32 extend from associated mounting pads or bases 34 that are secured to an outside surface 30 of the balloon 26. Typically, each mounting pad 34 is made of a relatively flexible polymeric material such as polyurethane and is bonded (e.g. heat bonded or adhesively bonded) to the outer surface 30 of the inflatable balloon 12. It can further be seen that each element 32 extends from its associated mounting pad 34 to an operative tip 38 that is capable of modifying the plaque with which it is urged into contact upon balloon inflation. The process is analogous to fracturing the plaque and causing a modified surface that in some cases may resemble the fractured windshield of an automobile. It can be further seen that the tip 38 of each plaque-modifying element 32 extends in a radial direction (“height”) which on average amounts to a distance “X” from the outer surface 30 of the balloon 26. The rise and fall (“pulse”) during balloon compression and decompression occurs over an average distance “x”. For the embodiment shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 , the plaque-modifying elements 32 are preferably bonded to the inflatable balloon 26. This structure limits the amount of a given element that can sink into ambient plaque, by analogy to a depth gauge. Regardless of whether a sheath is deployed, it is sometimes preferable that the plaque modifying elements 32 closer to the distal end 24 of the balloon 26 are closer to the balloon surface elements 32 that lie closer to the proximal end 22 of the balloon 12 to facilitate insertion of the catheter system 10 into the vasculature. In alternate embodiments, the plaque-modifying elements 32 are not too tightly located and are spaced apart. In some embodiments the average spacing between adjacent elements is at least 3 times the height of the tip above the outer surface of the balloon. This geometry permits navigation of the catheter system 10 around abrupt turns in the vasculature without adjacent elements 32 interfering with each other. The plaque-modifying elements are optionally aligned in longitudinally oriented rows on an outside surface of the balloon. In some embodiments, the plaque-modifying elements are aligned in laterally oriented rows on an outside surface of the balloon. Alternatively, the plaque-modifying elements are staggered so that an element in a row lies longitudinally between adjacent elements in a neighboring lateral row. The functionality of one sheath embodiment 40 can be appreciated with reference to FIG. 4. As shown, the optional sheath 40 , if deployed, protects the effective tips 38 of plaque-modifying elements 32 during transit of the balloon 26 and plaque-modifying elements 32 to the treatment site. After the system 10 is positioned at the treatment site and before the balloon 26 is expanded, the sheath 40 (if present) is withdrawn. The plaque-modifying elements 32 make their first contact with the tissue 14 (see FIG. 1 ). Once contact has been established between the tissue 14 and the plaque-modifying elements 32 , further pressurization over a short period of time of the inflatable balloon 26 causes the elements 32 to pulse outwardly radially for tissue modification. Plaque modification arises from localized weakening by fracture of for example calcified areas. Not only does fracture engender fissure formation (thereby weakening the fissured area), but it also reduces the stiffness of plaque-lined vessel walls while augmenting the surface area over which chemical reaction occurs if a pharmaceutically effective drug is delivered thereto. If desired, pressure can be applied quickly once, like a single hammer blow to a sheet of ice. Alternatively, pressure can be administered pulsatingly, like a jack hammer. Optionally the means for pressurizing 42 includes a control mechanism that allows the surgeon to administer either or both modes of pressure application. FIG. 5 illustrates a series of method steps that can be followed in practicing one aspect of the disclosed endovascular protocol. The steps include: A. Prepare a catheter subassembly. This step involves connecting a catheter which is covered at least partially somewhere but not necessarily completely between its intermediate region and distal end by an expansible balloon to an external source of fluid pressure. The source may optionally be provided with a pulsating means so that balloon expansion can be controlled and (if desired) affected rapidly, thereby creating a pulsating or hammer-like impact to a stenosed region. Optionally, pressure could be increased more slowly and stopped. B. Optionally cover the catheter subassembly with a sheath to form a catheter assembly. When used, the sheath protects potentially healthy vessel walls from abrasion by unprotected plaque-modifying elements. C. Insert the assembly into the vasculature. One insertion site is the femoral artery, although other sites may be used. Following insertion, the assembly is carefully pushed along the tortuous vascular passageways until it is juxtaposed with an anatomical site to be treated. D. If present, the sheath may then be removed, thereby exposing the plaque-modifying elements. E. The balloon is then expanded by the application of fluid pressure. If used, a saline solution or nitrous oxide, for example, can be first used to flood a chamber between the outside of the catheter and the inside of the balloon, thereby expanding it. If desired, a shockwave can be propagated through the relatively incompressible fluid so that a punching effect on the stenosed vessel wall can be created by rapidly moving plaque-modifying elements. Optionally: 1. pharmaceutical agent may be delivered by microchannels extending through the plaque-modifying elements to the stenosed region either before or after fracture; or 2. the drug may be bonded to the balloon wall and by contiguity eluted into the vessel (e.g., Paclitaxel is lipophilic and rapidly reacts within 60 seconds with the vessel wall). F. The balloon may then be deflated by evacuating the pressurizing fluid before the deflated balloon is covered with the sheath.'.\n",

      "Changed 'balloon' by 'composition' in 'The invention pertains generally to endovascular devices and methods and more particularly to plaque-modifying balloon catheters for treating vessels in the arterial vasculature. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (1) Field of the Invention Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedures can treat arterial disease. In such endovascular procedures, cutting balloons are sometimes considered as a treatment option for opening blocked coronary and peripheral vessels. Such balloons are sometimes configured so that balloon pressure is communicated to one or more cutting elements. Those elements may selectively cut stenosed vessel walls. In the hands of a skilled interventionist, PTA atherectomy procedures have sometimes reduced vessel recoil, lessened vessel tears and may have improved outcomes in comparison to traditional PTCA procedures. Severing elements used in such balloons can for analysis be said to include an effective surface feature (e.g., an edge) that is capable of incising or scoring vessel walls with which they come into contact. But if suitable precautions are not taken, the incising elements can tear, cut or perforate the thin, fragile inflation balloon during assembly, handling or use. It is also possible that an unintended balloon rupture could damage the arterial wall. This may result in loss of inflation fluid into the patient&#39;s vasculature. Another problem may arise if an inadvertent or unwanted cutting occurs of adjacent perhaps healthy tissue as the cutting balloon is being positioned or withdrawn from the vasculature. (2) Description of Related Art A device with a cutting edge which is covered within the pleats of an expandable clover leaf-shaped tube is disclosed by Shiber in U.S. Publication No. US 2002/0151924. However, such designs may fail to protect a fragile balloon during installation of the cutting edges, even before the device is used in situ. In addition, because the blades are situated within the balloon folds, creased portions of the balloon may be exposed to the blades when the device is navigated by twisting, turning and bending through narrow tortuous vasculature passageways. The following references, among others, were considered before filing this application: U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,686,824; 7,799,043; and 7,691,080. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Against this background, it would be advantageous to provide an assembly of plaque-modifying elements that are urged into contact with stenosed vessel walls and weaken those hardened portions as well as calcific plaques by creating and propagating localized fissures. Yet other desires include providing a catheter system with an assembly of plaque-modifying elements that extend from an inflatable balloon which is easy to use by surgeons of varying skill levels, is straightforward to make and is comparatively cost-effective. One aspect of the invention focuses on a plaque-modifying catheter system that includes an inflatable balloon which is provided with plaque-modifying elements that alter the surface and sub-surface characteristics of stenotic tissue at a treatment site in a vessel of a patient. For discussion and analysis, an embodiment of a catheter system falling within the scope of the present disclosure has an elongated balloon that defines a longitudinal axis. The balloon is inflatable from a first deflated configuration through intermediate second configurations to a third radially expanded configuration. In some embodiments, the balloon includes one or more stiff pedestals or footpads (“plaque-modifying elements”) that are brought into contact with plaque on vessel walls during inflation. For example, the pedestals could be considered as a punch or tool with a head that is circular, rounded (“domed”), x-shaped, star-shaped, polygonal, and the like. Its constituent material may include a hardened polymer. In some embodiments, the array of plaque-modifying elements is oriented longitudinally and mounted on the outside of the inflatable balloon. When the inflatable balloon is in the radially expanded configuration, at least some of the pedestals are urged outwardly radially by the inflatable balloon so that they are capable of fracturing hardened tissue (soft plaque, as well as calcific plaques). The balloon may further include on its outer surface one or more mounting pads that secure the pedestals to the balloons. For example, some of the pedestals may extend from an associated mounting pad that is affixed to the outer surface of the inflatable balloon. Optionally, the plaque-modifying balloon system includes one or more sheaths that are made of a relatively low durometer, flexible material. Functionally, if used, each sheath protects the vasculature from an operative surface feature of a plaque-modifying element during transit of the balloon to and from the treatment site. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS The novel features of this invention, as well as the invention itself, both as to its structure and its operation, will be best understood from the accompanying drawings, taken in conjunction with the accompanying description, in which similar reference characters refer to similar parts, and in which: FIG. 1 is a simplified, longitudinal cross sectional schematic view of a catheter system having an array of plaque-modifying elements operatively positioned in the body of a patient; FIG. 2 is a perspective view of one embodiment of the catheter system (without a covering sheath); FIG. 3 is perspective partially sectioned view of the embodiment of a plaque-modifying balloon system depicted in FIG. 2 ; FIG. 4 is a cross sectional view of the balloon system of FIGS. 1-3 shown after the balloon has been inflated to urge plaque-modifying elements radially outwardly before sheath removal; FIG. 5 illustrates method steps that exemplify how the catheter system is used. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention. Referring initially to FIG. 1 , a plaque-modifying catheter system 10 is shown with an expansible balloon 12 that supports plaque-modifying elements 32. The system 10 enables a surgeon to perform an endovascular procedure in which a catheter with a deflated balloon surrounding it is inserted percutaneously into a blood vessel (e.g., a femoral artery) to treat vascular disease. More specifically, the catheter system 10 is depicted as being positioned to treat a lesion 14 in an artery 16 such as but not limited to a coronary, renal, popliteal or femoral artery, the aorta or other artery. But those skilled in the art will recognize that the use of the catheter system 10 as herein described is not limited to treatment of a specific artery. Instead it can be deployed in vascular conduits and other ductal systems throughout the human body. In FIGS. 1-4 , there is depicted one embodiment of a plaque-modifying catheter system 10 with an open inner lumen 18. In that embodiment, the system 10 has a catheter (tube) 20 with a proximal end 22 and a distal end 24. As used herein, “proximal” is used in relation to the surgeon. The inner lumen 18 extends between the proximal 22 and distal 24 ends so that a medical device or fluid may pass through the lumen 18 without interruption or interference. If desired, the disclosed invention could be used as a blood perfusion balloon catheter such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,617. Such catheters can be used in administering treatments to relieve stenotic regions within a body lumen while maintaining blood flow past the dilation balloons. Perfusion ports in one example can be provided in both a guide wire lumen and in a bypass lumen in order to provide increased blood flow. Abstract, &#39;617 patent. Thus, the plaque-modifying balloon 12 includes an expandable balloon 26 ( FIG. 4 ) that is located proximate to and circumscribes at least the distal end region 22 of the catheter 20. The expandable balloon 26 encapsulates a pressurizing fluid (such as a saline solution or nitrous oxide) in a chamber 28 formed between the catheter 20 and the balloon 26 , which causes the balloon 26 to inflate. The balloon 26 has an outer surface 30 which may optionally at least partially have a dry coating. The pressurizing fluid is delivered by means for pressurizing, maintaining and deflating the chamber 28 formed between the catheter and the balloon (such as a pump in communication with an activator for imparting a rapid rise in pressure). An assembly of plaque-modifying elements 32 is mounted on at least a part of the outer surface 30 of the balloon 26. Without being bound to any theory of operation, the modifying elements 32 are thought to break collagen and distend elastin in the intima and media of a vessel wall 16 , thereby weakening the intima and media and superimposing (by, for example “stamping” or “embossing” or “fracturing”) a pattern of weakened areas in the vessel wall 16. Such weakened areas may allow the vessel wall 16 to become more flexible, to bend and to distend radially. In one treatment protocol, it is envisioned that the step of pressurizing the balloon is completed in about 1-5 seconds and the step of depressurizing the balloon is completed in a similar time. Optionally the step of contacting the balloon with a vessel wall to be treated is completed over a dwell time of about 1-5 minutes or longer if desired. In one embodiment, at least some of the modifying elements 32 are supported from a base 34 extending from the outer surface 30 of the balloon 26. Extending outwardly from the base 34 is a shaft 36. A plaque-modifying tip 38 is situated atop the shaft 36. The plaque-modifying tip 38 has a cross section geometry selected from the group consisting of a polygon, an oval, a circle, a dome, an ellipse, an “x” shape, a star shape and a “y” shape. In an embodiment, optionally, a retractable sheath 40 at least partially covers the modifying elements 32 as the catheter system 10 is maneuvered through a tortuous vasculature. The sheath 40 can be retracted to expose at least a part of the plaque-modifying assembly 32 when the assembly 32 is juxtaposed with a site to be treated. If desired, the sheath 40 can be repositioned to cover the plaque-modifying assembly 32 before the catheter system 10 is withdrawn. Not shown in communication with the balloon 26 are one or more conventional fluid ports for pressurization and relief of the chamber 28 between the catheter 20 and the balloon 26. It will be appreciated that the proximal portion 22 of the catheter 20 is connected to the distal end 26 of an inflation mechanism or the means for inflation 42 ( FIG. 1 ). Typically, the inflatable balloon 26 is made of a polymeric material such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or nylon and its outside diameter is about 6-8 French. As best seen in FIG. 4 , the inflatable balloon 26 can be thought of as having an outer surface 30 and an opposed inner surface 46 that surrounds an inflation volume or chamber 28 that can be infused with a medical grade fluid to expand the inflatable balloon 26. It will be appreciated that an inflation device 42 (not shown) may include a syringe that can be activated to pump the medical grade fluid (such as a saline solution) to expand the inflatable balloon 26. In FIGS. 1-4 , the plaque-modifying elements 32 may assume various alternative forms. These include tips 38 that are circular, rounded (“domed”), x-shaped, star-shaped, polygonal, and the like in a variety of configurations, e.g., an array of longitudinally or laterally spaced or aligned sets, as shown in FIGS. 2-3. As seen in FIG. 4 , in one embodiment, the modifying elements 32 are distributed around the circumference 30 of an operative section of the inflatable balloon 26. Typically, at least some of the modifying elements 32 are made of a medical grade material such as a hard plastic like polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). As best seen in FIG. 4 , a portion of at least some of the modifying elements 32 extend from associated mounting pads or bases 34 that are secured to an outside surface 30 of the balloon 26. Typically, each mounting pad 34 is made of a relatively flexible polymeric material such as polyurethane and is bonded (e.g. heat bonded or adhesively bonded) to the outer surface 30 of the inflatable balloon 12. It can further be seen that each element 32 extends from its associated mounting pad 34 to an operative tip 38 that is capable of modifying the plaque with which it is urged into contact upon balloon inflation. The process is analogous to fracturing the plaque and causing a modified surface that in some cases may resemble the fractured windshield of an automobile. It can be further seen that the tip 38 of each plaque-modifying element 32 extends in a radial direction (“height”) which on average amounts to a distance “X” from the outer surface 30 of the balloon 26. The rise and fall (“pulse”) during balloon compression and decompression occurs over an average distance “x”. For the embodiment shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 , the plaque-modifying elements 32 are preferably bonded to the inflatable balloon 26. This structure limits the amount of a given element that can sink into ambient plaque, by analogy to a depth gauge. Regardless of whether a sheath is deployed, it is sometimes preferable that the plaque modifying elements 32 closer to the distal end 24 of the balloon 26 are closer to the balloon surface elements 32 that lie closer to the proximal end 22 of the balloon 12 to facilitate insertion of the catheter system 10 into the vasculature. In alternate embodiments, the plaque-modifying elements 32 are not too tightly located and are spaced apart. In some embodiments the average spacing between adjacent elements is at least 3 times the height of the tip above the outer surface of the balloon. This geometry permits navigation of the catheter system 10 around abrupt turns in the vasculature without adjacent elements 32 interfering with each other. The plaque-modifying elements are optionally aligned in longitudinally oriented rows on an outside surface of the balloon. In some embodiments, the plaque-modifying elements are aligned in laterally oriented rows on an outside surface of the balloon. Alternatively, the plaque-modifying elements are staggered so that an element in a row lies longitudinally between adjacent elements in a neighboring lateral row. The functionality of one sheath embodiment 40 can be appreciated with reference to FIG. 4. As shown, the optional sheath 40 , if deployed, protects the effective tips 38 of plaque-modifying elements 32 during transit of the balloon 26 and plaque-modifying elements 32 to the treatment site. After the system 10 is positioned at the treatment site and before the balloon 26 is expanded, the sheath 40 (if present) is withdrawn. The plaque-modifying elements 32 make their first contact with the tissue 14 (see FIG. 1 ). Once contact has been established between the tissue 14 and the plaque-modifying elements 32 , further pressurization over a short period of time of the inflatable balloon 26 causes the elements 32 to pulse outwardly radially for tissue modification. Plaque modification arises from localized weakening by fracture of for example calcified areas. Not only does fracture engender fissure formation (thereby weakening the fissured area), but it also reduces the stiffness of plaque-lined vessel walls while augmenting the surface area over which chemical reaction occurs if a pharmaceutically effective drug is delivered thereto. If desired, pressure can be applied quickly once, like a single hammer blow to a sheet of ice. Alternatively, pressure can be administered pulsatingly, like a jack hammer. Optionally the means for pressurizing 42 includes a control mechanism that allows the surgeon to administer either or both modes of pressure application. FIG. 5 illustrates a series of method steps that can be followed in practicing one aspect of the disclosed endovascular protocol. The steps include: A. Prepare a catheter subassembly. This step involves connecting a catheter which is covered at least partially somewhere but not necessarily completely between its intermediate region and distal end by an expansible balloon to an external source of fluid pressure.

      "Changed 'position' by 'liquid' in 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention [0001] The invention relates to extraction appliances for preparing drinks or the like, from an extraction material, for example ground coffee, which is contained in a capsule. In particular, it relates to a brewing module for an extraction appliance, to a capsule recognition module, as well as to a drinks preparation machine with such a brewing module and/or capsule recognition module. Description of Related Art [0002] Extraction appliances for preparing drinks or the like, from an extraction material which is present in a portion package, are known, for example, as coffee machines or espresso machines. In many corresponding systems, the portion packages are designed as capsules, in which the extraction material is sealed for example in an airtight manner. For extraction, the capsule is pierced, for example at two sides, which are opposite to one another. An extraction fluid—generally hot water—is introduced at the first side. The extraction product is discharged from the capsule at the second side. This takes place in a so-called brewing module. Such a module includes a brewing chamber, in which the capsule is received. Brewing modules, with which the capsule is inserted and the brewing chamber is closed manually by way of an operating lever or automatically in a motorised manner are particularly popular, wherein the capsule is automatically removed from the brewing chamber and ejected into a capsule container, after the brewing procedure on renewed opening of the brewing chamber. Such brewing modules with an automatic capsule ejection are generally designed as horizontal brewing modules, i.e. the insertion of the capsule is effected from above, the closure of the brewing chamber is a horizontal relative movement of two brewing chamber parts, the brewing fluid flows essentially horizontally and the capsule container is formed below the brewing chamber. [0003] A drinks preparation machine, which includes a positioning device for holding a capsule inserted into the machine, in an intermediate position outside the brewing module, is known from WO 2012/123440. In this intermediate position, a sensor arrangement can read out information that is present on the capsule for example and activate an automatic transfer of the capsule into the brewing module and start the brewing process, depending on the result of the read-out. This procedure has the advantage that a capsule recognition and a brewing process, which is adapted to the recognised capsule, are possible. However, the relatively complicated mechanisms, which are required for a meaningful implementation and which either have several units, which are motorically driven independently of one another or a coupling mechanism rendering an insertion of the capsule during a brewing process not possible, are disadvantageous. [0004] EP 1 786 303 likewise discloses a drinks preparation device with a sensor arrangement for detecting characteristics of an inserted portion package in the form of a pod. The brewing module includes two brewing module parts, which are pivotable to one another. Due to this pivotability, the brewing chamber formed between the brewing module parts can be open to the top, closed or open to the bottom for the ejection of the portion package. After insertion, the portion package is held in an intermediate position on the upper side of the brewing module parts, in a manner laterally guided, and the detection of the characteristics takes place there. Inasmuch as the portion package has been recognised, the brewing chamber is subsequently opened to the top by way of pivoting the brewing module parts, so that the portion package can drop into the brewing chamber, whereupon the brewing chamber is closed by a renewed pivoting movement running in the opposite direction. The brewing process is then carried out and the brewing chamber is subsequently opened to the bottom by way of continuing the pivoting movement, by which means the portion package is ejected to the bottom. [0005] This procedure is suitable for the relatively flat portion packages known as pods. However, it cannot be applied to beaker-like or, for example, cuboid portion capsules without further ado. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] It is an object of the invention, to provide a drinks (beverage) preparation machine that overcomes disadvantages of the state of the art and permits the detection of characteristics of an applied portion capsule before the brewing process, by way of an as simple as possible design. [0007] A brewing module according to the invention, for a drinks preparation machine for preparing a brewed drink from a portion capsule comprises: [0008] a housing which includes a capsule insert opening, through which opening the capsule, for example in a defined orientation, can be inserted; [0009] a first brewing module part and a second brewing module part, which is movable relative to this, wherein a brewing chamber, which during the brewing process at least partly surrounds the capsule located in the brewing position, can be formed by the first and the second brewing module part, wherein the brewing module is designed to brew a brewed drink by way of introducing a brewing fluid into the capsule, and to discharge the brewed drink out of the capsule; [0010] wherein the first and second brewing module part are movable relative to one another between three different, defined positions, [0011] wherein the brewing chamber is formed in the first position, [0012] wherein after a movement from the first into the second position, a capsule located in the brewing chamber drops downwards into a capsule container due to the effect of gravity, wherein however in the second position, the brewing module parts have the effect that a capsule inserted through the capsule insert opening is held vertically above a height of the brewing position, at a capsule recognition position, [0013] wherein in the third position, a capsule located at the capsule recognition position can drop down from this, essentially to the height of the brewing position and [0014] wherein the second position is between the first position and the third position. [0015] The first position corresponds to the closed condition of the brewing chamber. What is new about the approach according to the invention is that there are two different, defined conditions, in which the brewing chamber is opened and a capsule can drop downwards after the brewing process. These conditions with an opened brewing chamber are defined by the second and third position. In the second position, the brewing chamber is open to the bottom, but quasi closed to the top for the insertion of the capsule, and only in the third position is it completely open to the top and the bottom. [0016] The position, into which the capsule drops from the capsule recognition position when the brewing module parts are in the third position, can directly be the brewing position. However, one can also envisage the capsule dropping into an intermediate position, in particular at the vertical height of the brewing position and only being displaced into the brewing position on closing the brewing chamber, i.e. the transfer of the brewing module parts into the first position. [0017] The capsule can be guided on dropping from the capsule recognition position, and is stopped at the height of the brewing position and/or—as the case may be—the intermediate position, which can be effected by way of laterally engaging, pivotable or non-pivotable guide means, such as described for example in WO 2105/048914, or also by way of other means as are known for example from WO 2013/110206, or, as the case may be also according to WO 2010/118545, by way of a rest which simultaneously forms a delimitation of the brewing chamber. [0018] The brewing module can include capsule recognition means, in order to recognise characteristics of a capsule located in the capsule recognition position, on the basis of predefined features. With capsule recognition means, in particular one can firstly determine whether the inserted capsule is suitable for use in the drinks preparation machine in the first place, or not—and this is known per se. Secondly, there exists the possibility of issuing corresponding information to the user, for example via a display, on the basis of the recognised capsule characteristics. For example, the drink type (coffee, tea, etc.), the sort (e.g. “100% Arabica”), the recommended preparation manner (e.g. “espresso”, “ristretto” or “lungo” etc.) and/or other information can be displayed. Thirdly, the program, which is implemented by the coffee machine for the brewing, can be selected on the basis of the recognised capsule sort, for example the brewing pressure, the brewing duration as well as possibly also the temperature and/or other characteristics can be set depending on whether the inserted capsule is envisaged for the preparation of e.g. ristretto, espresso or lungo. [0019] The capsule recognition means can detect optical and/or other characteristics of the capsule. Magnetic characteristics and/or an RFID chip readable in a contact-free manner can also be applied as recognition features, apart from suitable optically readable features, for example a bar code, a 2D matrix code (for example QR code or Aztec code), a pictogram (icon), a code according to one of the European patent applications 14 197 487.3, 14 197 488.1 and/or 14 197 489.9 and/or a certain colouring. [0020] The procedure according to the invention has the advantage that a new capsule can be inserted when the brewing module parts are in the first position (the brewing chamber is closed, for example during the brewing process), as well as when the brewing module parts are in the second position or whilst they are moved from the first into the second position, thus for example after completion of the brewing process. For example, the capsule recognition process for a second capsule can therefore begin whilst the brewing process for a first capsule is still in process. [0021] Despite this advantage, the brewing module or the drinks preparation machine makes do without additional moving parts, and a single drive is sufficient. [0022] In particular, the movement of the brewing module parts relative to one another is a linear movement, i.e. a translation along an axis. A pivotability of the brewing modes parts is not necessary due to the approach according to the invention, but is also not ruled out. [0023] In particular, the brewing module is a horizontal brewing module, and the axis of the movement in particular is an essentially horizontal axis, i.e. it runs parallel to the surface, on which the drinks preparation machine is placed, or roughly parallel to this, for example up to an angle of maximal 20°. [0024] The first, second and the third brewing position can be defined mechanically, by way of stops and/or as latching positions or the like. [0025] In embodiments, the drive for the movement of the brewing module parts relative to one another in particular is an electrical drive. In these embodiments, the first, second and/or third position, in particular the second position, can also be defined electronically, by way of the electrical drive being programmed such that it moves the brewing module parts relative to one another, in each case by a predefined movement path. In such embodiments, the activation of the electrical drive for example likewise belongs to the brewing module, even if, with regard to its location, it is present at another location of the drinks preparation machine and is integrated for example into the activation of the complete machine. [0026] The activation of the drive in particular can be programmed such that a moving into the third position is not effected until after a capsule recognition procedure has been effected and that the brewing module parts always travel from the first into the second position after the brewing procedure has been effected, unless a capsule recognition procedure with a next capsule has already taken place during the brewing procedure. [0027] According to an embodiment example, a pinion driven by an electric motor moves a pivot lever with a toothing matching with the pinion, the pivot lever being connected to a lever arm of a toggle lever or forming this. The toggle lever effects a translation movement of the brewing module part between the first position and the third position. [0028] In many embodiments, one of the brewing module parts (hereinafter “the stationary brewing module part”, for example the discharge device) is assembled in a manner in which it is fixed to the housing, whilst the other brewing module part (hereinafter “the moved brewing module part”, for example the injector) is moved with the transition between the positions. The relative movement of the brewing module parts to one another is then therefore effected by way of the movement of only the moved brewing module part. [0029] The circumstance that the brewing module parts have the effect that a capsule inserted through the capsule insert opening is stopped vertically above the brewing position at a capsule recognition position, can be accomplished, for example, by way of a rest portion of one of the brewing module parts—in particular of the moved brewing module part. Such a rest portion can block an insertion path downwards from the capsule recognition position to such an extent that the capsule cannot drop further downwards. If, as is known per se, the capsule is guided in its orientation by way of suitable lateral guide means, then this can be effected by a portion of the moved brewing module part, which in the second position projects only slightly into the insertion path. On account of this, the brewing module in particular can be designed such that the rest portion is fixedly connected to the remainder of the brewing module part and for example even designed as one piece with this, and thus makes do without moving parts between the rest portion and the portions of the brewing module part that co-form the brewing chamber. [0030] In embodiments, an element of the one brewing module part, which at the upper side projects towards the other brewing module part, forms the rest portion. [0031] A capsule recognition module can be applied for reading out capsule characteristics at the capsule recognition position. Such a capsule recognition module can include an optical sensor, in particular a camera for detecting optical characteristics of the capsule. A window (capsule recognition window) of a transparent material, which protects the camera from water vapour and contamination, can be present between the camera and the capsule located at the capsule recognition position. [0032] In embodiments, an active fan for producing an airflow at the side of the capsule recognition window, which is towards the capsule recognition position, is also present. [0033] A fogging of the capsule recognition window is efficiently prevented by way of such a fan. It has been found that the reliability of the capsule recognition can be significantly improved by way of this measure, which per se is quite simple. [0034] A capsule recognition window of the mentioned type can be arranged at a non-right angle for example of 80° at the most, to an axis between the capsule recognition position and the optical sensor. Reflections of the light source at the window are not visible from the location of the optical sensor on account of this. [0035] Here, the axis between the capsule recognition position and the optical sensor is to be understood as an axis in the optical sense, i.e. in the case of light deflecting means between the capsule recognition position and the sensor, the axis does not necessarily correspond to a direct connection, but to a beam path of a light beam which goes along the shortest path, from the middle of a surface of the capsule at the capsule recognition position, said surface being detected by the camera, to the middle of the sensor. If the optical sensor is a camera with camera optics, then the axis can coincide with an optical axis (axis of symmetry) of the camera optics. [0036] A capsule recognition module can moreover include at least one light source for illuminating the capsule at the capsule recognition position, in particular behind the capsule recognition window, i.e. at the side of the capsule recognition window that is towards the optical sensor. Such a light source can, for example, include an LED or a number of LEDs. A light diffuser can be present between the light source and the capsule recognition position, for example likewise behind the window, in order to prevent any occurring reflections on the capsule, particular in cases, in which the capsule surface acts in a slightly reflecting manner. [0037] The invention also relates to a drinks preparation machine with a brewing module according to the invention.

BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION [0002] 1. Field of Invention [0003] The present invention relates to a technical field of medical consumables, and more particularly to a repair material with multi-purpose for an abdominal wall hernia. [0004] 2. Description of Related Arts [0005] Hernia is a fascial defect in structure. For example, an organ or part of the organ, or a tissue or part of the tissue is able to be extended through the fascial defect of an abdominal wall. Commonly, the hernia structurally comprises weakened, bulged or actually torn fascia of an organ or a tissue. There are many types of hernias. For example, if happening to a lower abdominal area, the hernia often contains intra-abdominal contents such as intestines or other tissues which enter or pass through the abdominal wall defect. Mesh patch is widely used in hernia repair. Conventionally, widely used patches are polyester meshes (such as Dacron and Mersilene), and polypropylene meshes (such as Marlex, Prolene, etc.). However, a simple non-degradable mesh is not suitable for intra-peritoneal implantation, because organ adhesions may occur with the patch, leading to serious complications such as infertility, chronic pelvic pain, intestinal fistula, intestinal obstruction, etc. A common solution is inserting a physical barrier at a position where adhesions are undesirable. However, this barrier leads to connecting problems in the interior of the barrier, because if the barrier is prepared by a non-absorbable material, the barrier itself becomes an adhesion source; if the barrier is absorbable, absorption must be non-inflammatory, for not leading to self-adhesion. [0006] The ePTFE developed by Gore Company is an adhesion layer resistance product (Gore-Tex® Surgical Membrane), which provides effective tissue separation. However, the material is easy to cause infection, and must be removed through a second surgery after infection. In addition, due to a high material shrinkage rate, mesothelial cells are not able to grow into the material, so it is difficult to form a new peritoneum (Harrell A G, Novitsky Y W, Peindl R D, et al. Prospective evaluation of adhesion formation and shrinkage of intra-abdominal prosthetics in a rabbit model Am Surg 2006, 72: 808-14.). [0007] International patent WO2009079271A2 discloses a Proceed multi-layer mesh developed by American Johnson &amp; Johnson Company, wherein the multi-layer mesh comprises a polypropylene mesh layer, a poly-dioxanone layer (PDS) and an oxidized regenerated cellulose membrane layer (ORC). A composite method thereof comprises directly thermal-pressing an ORC knitted mesh having a certain moisture content with a PDS membrane and a polypropylene mesh, and increasing binding forces between different layers with the moisture content. However, a sample prepared by the method is easy to be separated, wherein the layers of the sample are able to be separated by a tensile testing machine, and softness thereof is poor, which means a compliance with the abdominal wall needs to be improved. As a result, there will be a strong foreign body sensation after implantation. [0008] U.S. Pat. No. 6,451,032B1 discloses a Parietex mesh of Tyco Company, comprising a mesh woven by polyethylene terephthalate yarn, composite collagen, polyethylene glycol and glycerin; wherein a collagen solution is oxidized by periodic acid for self-crosslinking, and forms a first layer with the polyethylene glycol and the glycerol; a second layer is basically the same as the first layer. The first layer and the second layer are composited with the polyethylene terephthalate mesh for achieving multi-layer composite. According to the method, chemical reactions are involved and strong oxidizing agents are used. Furthermore, direct binding between the mesh and natural macromolecule collagen which is difficult to form a membrane is not stable. [0009] Chinese patent CN101035574A and international patent WO 2005105172A1 both disclose a Sepramesh mesh developed by BARD Company, which is a double-layer mesh woven by polypropylene yarn and polyglycolic acid yarn. The double-layer is formed by immersing a polyglycolic acid layer in a modified hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose solution and a modified polyethylene glycol solution, wherein the hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose is crosslinked by a carbodiimide type crosslinking agent; a polyethylene glycol derivative is acrylate-terminated; and polymerization in the solution is initiated by light. Preparation of the product involves a lot of chemical reactions, which is complex and greatly increases manufacturing costs during production. [0010] The above mentioned products have problems such as complicated preparation processes, a lot of chemical reactions, layers which are easy to be separated, poor softness and controversial anti-adhesion effects, and prices of the above products are very high. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION [0011] For overcoming the above technical problems in the conventional technologies, an object of the present invention is to provide a repair material with multi-purpose for an abdominal wall hernia. [0012] Accordingly, the repair material with multi-purpose for an abdominal wall hernia comprises an absorbable membrane, wherein the absorbable membrane is prepared with a mixed solution of a PLCL and an MPEG-PLLA copolymer. [0013] The PLCL is an L-lactide/caprolactone copolymer, wherein in the L-lactide/caprolactone copolymer, a mole ratio between L-lactide and caprolactone is 50:50-90:10; and an intrinsic viscosity of the L-lactide/caprolactone copolymer at 25° C. is 1.0-2.5 dl/g. [0014] The MPEG-PLLA copolymer, a molecular weight of MPEG is 2000-10000, and a molecular weight of PLLA is 3000-8000. Preferably, the molecular weight of the MPEG is 2000-5000, and the molecular weight of the PLLA is 5000-6000. [0015] A mole ratio between the PLCL and the MPEG-PLLA copolymer in the mixed solution is 5:5-7:3. [0016] The repair material comprises a polypropylene mesh with an absorbable coating thereon, and the absorbable membrane press-fitted on the polypropylene mesh; the absorbable coating is formed by applying the mixed solution of the PLCL and the MPEG-PLLA copolymer to the polypropylene mesh. [0017] A density of the polypropylene mesh is 20-80 g/m 2 , and a thickness thereof is 1-5 mm. Preferably, the density of the polypropylene mesh is 20-50 g/m 2 , the thickness thereof is 1-3 mm; and a single hole area of the polypropylene mesh is 3-20 mm 2. [0018] The absorbable membrane has a drainage hole thereon. [0019] The present invention also provides a method for preparing a repair material with multi-purpose for an abdominal wall hernia. [0020] The method comprises steps of: [0021] (1) immersing a polypropylene mesh into a mixed solution for forming an absorbable coating on a surface of the polypropylene mesh after being dried; [0022] (2) pouring the mixed solution into a mould, statically evaporating for obtaining an absorbable membrane; and [0023] (3) press-fitting the polypropylene mesh obtained in the step (1) to the absorbable membrane and statically evaporating; [0024] wherein the mixed solution is a mixed solution of a PLCL and an MPEG-PLLA copolymer. [0025] The repair material of the present invention is suitable for abdominal wall defects due to incisional hernia, parastomal hernia, umbilical hernia, inguinal hernia and peritoneal tumor resection, and is applicable to intra-abdominal hernia repair of abdominal wall hernia and the abdominal wall defects, as well as laparoscopic inguinal hernia. Compared with the prior art, the present invention has beneficial effects as follows. [0026] Compared with the PLCL, the repair material of the present invention is significantly improved in water absorption of the absorbable membrane. A material rigidity is lowered to ameliorate healing effects, and a contact angle is greatly reduced. As a result, postoperative abdominal wall compliance is sufficient, which basically provides no discomfort. Therefore, compared with the PLCL, the present invention is more comfortable. In addition, in the repair material of the present invention, polypropylene is completely fitted with the absorbable membrane, wherein no obvious boundary face is observed through a microscope, and separation never occurred. [0027] These and other objectives, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.

No. 60/965,464, filed Aug. 20, 2007 by Paul A. Chambers for UNIVERSAL MINER SELF RESCUER (UMSR) (Attorney&#39;s Docket No. CHAMB-13 PROV). [0005] The three above-identified patent applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0006] This invention relates to self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBAs) in general, and more particularly to a self-contained breathing apparatus with a safety quick disconnect for permitting safe and ready access to a replacement breathing component. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0007] The nature of underground mining operations makes them highly dangerous. [0008] For example, in the case of a mine collapse, the supply of breathable air can be severely compromised, placing the miners in great danger. [0009] Furthermore, mines are often highly susceptible to the infusion of noxious gases (e.g., methane, carbon monoxide, etc.). This situation can occur in many scenarios, even where there is no catastrophic mine collapse. Gas pockets can be exposed at any time and without notice, and can be life-threatening even where the mine is structurally intact. In any of these situations, once the gas enters the space occupied by the miners, their lives are in serious danger. [0010] In all of these situations, the miners must quickly recognize the danger and then must obtain an supply of breathable air. This supply of breathable air may be provided by various means, e.g., a filtered system, a conventional “open-loop” self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), a conventional “closed-loop” self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), a solid state oxygen generator, etc. The equipment for providing the supply of breathable air is commonly referred to as a Self Rescuer and is generally carried by the miners on their belts. Once the miners have “switched over” to this supply of breathable air, they must then escape the danger zone. In the case of a “benign” gas pocket, escape may be as simple as walking or riding a mine car out of the affected area. In the case of a mine collapse, gas explosion, or other serious event, escape may involve crawling, tunneling, walking or just waiting for rescue. In any of these latter situations, there is a significant danger that the supply of breathable air may be depleted before the miner has reached a safe location. [0011] At the same time, in many of these situations, it is not possible for the miners to use conventional negative pressure filtered respirators, powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), etc. due to the nature of the threat, e.g., the possible air contaminants (e.g., some gases), the physical state of the ambient air (e.g., super-heated air), etc. In these situations, a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is required. [0012] Conventional “open-loop” SCBA units generally consist of a tank of compressed gas (usually ambient, but filtered, air) with the flow controlled by a regulator or demand valve. One of the major inefficiencies of these units is that the exhausted and/or exhaled air (still containing significant usable oxygen) is vented to the environment and thus lost to the user. Much greater efficiencies (translating into smaller, lighter units and longer supply times) can be attained by using “closed loop” SCBA units which recycle the exhaust air and recover the oxygen, and/or remove the undesirable products of respiration (mainly carbon dioxide). A device utilizing this approach is commonly referred as a “Rebreather”. See FIG. 1. [0013] Any respirator device, whether filtered, open-loop SCBA, closed-loop SCBA, etc. has a limited capacity to supply breathable air. If the miners exhaust the capacity of the respirator device while still in a dangerous environment, the miners must be able to access a replacement breathing component and make the “change-over” to the replacement breathing component without “breaking the seal” or otherwise exposing themselves to breathing in the potentially noxious gases. [0014] As a result, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) which is able to safely and quickly connect to a replacement breathing component without “breaking the seal” so that the replacement breathing component can supply additional breathing capacity to the user. Preferably, the replacement breathing component can take any number of forms, e.g., the working portion of another “closed-loop” SCBA, an air bottle, a carbon monoxide filter respirator, etc. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0015] The present invention provides a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) which is able to safely and quickly connect to a replacement breathing component without “breaking the seal” so that the replacement breathing component can supply additional breathing capacity to the user. [0016] In one form of the present invention, there is provided a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) comprising: [0017] a mouthpiece; [0018] a breathing component for providing breathable air, the breathing component comprising a component interface; and [0019] a safety quick disconnect comprising: a valve body defining: an internal chamber; an opening communicating with the internal chamber and connectable with the mouthpiece; first and second ports communicating with the internal chamber; first and second mounts formed on the body adjacent to the first and second ports, respectively, for receiving the component interface of the breathing component, the first and second mounts being configured so as to place the breathing component into communication with the internal chamber when the component interface is in engagement with one or the other of the first and second mounts; a valve spool selectively rotatably disposed within the internal chamber, wherein the valve spool comprises an L-shaped channel formed such that when the valve spool is appropriately rotated, the L-shaped channel (i) places the opening in communication with the first port, or (ii) places the opening in communication with the second port; and a lock mechanism for (i) preventing the valve spool from being rotated unless the component interface of the breathing component is positioned in one of the first and second mounts and a component interface of a replacement breathing component is positioned in the other of the first and second mounts, and (ii) preventing the removal of a component interface from a mount adjacent to a port which is in communication with the opening. [0027] In another form of the present invention, there is provided a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) comprising: [0028] a mouthpiece; [0029] a counterlung; and [0030] a breathing component interposed between the mouthpiece and the counterlung, the breathing component being adapted to provide breathable air; wherein the counterlung is sized so as to have a volume which is approximately equal to the tidal volume of a pair of adult lungs. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0031] These and other objects and features of the present invention will be more fully disclosed or rendered obvious by the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, which are to be considered together with the accompanying drawings wherein like numbers refer to like elements and further wherein: [0032] FIG. 1 is a schematic view showing a prior art SCBA; [0033] FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing a high-level overview of a novel SCBA formed in accordance with the present invention; [0034] FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing a more detailed illustration of a novel SCBA formed in accordance with the present invention; [0035] FIG. 4 is a schematic view showing a novel breathing component formed in accordance with the present invention; [0036] FIGS. 5-11 are schematic views showing a novel safety quick disconnect of the present invention; [0037] FIGS. 12-14 are schematic views illustrating how a breathing component and a replacement breathing component may be simultaneously connected to the safety quick disconnect, with only one breathing component being operable at a given time; [0038] FIGS. 15-17 are schematic views showing how a depleted breathing component may be “switched out” (i.e., changed over) to a replacement breathing component; [0039] FIGS. 18-23 are schematic views illustrating various configurations for a novel breathing component formed in accordance with the present invention; and [0040] FIGS. 24-27 are schematic views illustrating various types of breathing components which can be connected to the safety quick disconnect. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0041] Looking next at FIGS. 2 and 3 , there is shown a novel self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) 5 formed in accordance with the present invention. SCBA 5 generally comprises a mouthpiece 10 which is releasably connected to a multi-port safety quick disconnect 15. Also connected to quick disconnect 15 is a breathing component 20. A replacement breathing component 20 A may also be connected to quick disconnect 15 when breathing component 20 is to be replaced. [0042] Looking now at FIGS. 2-4 , breathing component 20 preferably comprises a demand regulator 25 , a carbon dioxide scrubber 30 and a counterlung 35. Breathing component 20 also comprises an oxygen supply 40. [0043] During use, the user places mouthpiece 10 in their mouth and inhales and exhales through their mouth (a noseclip may also be supplied to restrict breathing through the nose and permit breathing through only the mouth). As air is exhaled, it passes through demand regulator 25 , through carbon dioxide scrubber 30 and fills counterlung 35. As this occurs, carbon dioxide scrubber 30 purges carbon dioxide from the exhaled air. Conversely, as air is inhaled, air is drawn from counterlung 35 , through carbon dioxide scrubber 30 , through demand regulator 25 and back into the lungs of the user. Again, as the air from counterlung 35 passes through carbon dioxide scrubber 30 , the scrubber purges carbon dioxide from the air. [0044] Demand regulator 25 monitors the air pressure in the system and, when the air pressure falls below a certain threshold, releases supplemental oxygen from oxygen supply 40. More particularly, as the user breathes, the body metabolizes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is then removed from the system by carbon dioxide scrubber 30. Therefore, in a “closed-loop” system, as the user breathes, oxygen is consumed by the user, carbon dioxide is consumed by the scrubber, and the quantity of air is reduced. To that end, demand regulator 25 monitors the air pressure in the system and, as the quantity of air is reduced during breathing and scrubbing (which also reflects a reduction in the quantity of oxygen available for breathing), demand regulator 25 releases supplemental oxygen to the system to compensate for the consumed gases. [0045] As a result of this construction, breathing component 20 is designed to provide extended breathing capacity, due to the use of (i) carbon dioxide scrubber 30 , which allows the re-breathing of exhaled air, and (ii) demand regulator 25 and oxygen supply 40 , which supply supplemental oxygen to the system as oxygen is consumed through breathing. [0046] Significantly, counterlung 35 is carefully configured so as to have a size approximately equal to tidal volume of a pair of human lungs. This is approximately three times smaller than traditional counterlungs. By configuring counterlung 35 with this unique size, breathing component 20 ensures that demand regulator 25 will release fresh oxygen to the system before the oxygen content of the air being re-breathed falls to a level which is too low to safely sustain the user. More particularly, with each breath of the user, approximately 20% of the oxygen inhaled is consumed by the body and is replaced with exhaled carbon dioxide. This exhaled carbon dioxide is in turn purged by carbon dioxide scrubber 30. Thus, in the absence of a supplemental oxygen source, as the user breathes, the total quantity of air will continuously decrease as the carbon dioxide is pulled from the air. If counterlung 35 is made too large, it will take too long for the quantity of air in the system to be depleted to the point where demand regulator 25 will trigger the release of supplemental oxygen from oxygen supply 40. On the other hand, if counterlung 35 is formed too small, a user will not be able to inhale and exhale a full breath, which is important in emergency breathing situations where the user may need to be moving about rapidly. Sizing counterlung 35 so as to be the approximately the size of the tidal volume of a pair of lungs is a new and significant advance in the art. [0047] In another significant advance over the prior art, SCBA 5 utilizes a multi-port safety quick disconnect 15 to permit replacement breathing component 20 A to be safely and quickly connected to mouthpiece 10 without “breaking the seal”, so that additional breathing capacity can be safely supplied to the user when necessary. More particularly, any breathing component (e.g., a “closed-loop” SCBA system, a carbon dioxide absorber, an oxygen tank, etc.) has a finite functional lifetime: at the end of that functional lifetime, the breathing component must ultimately be replaced with a fresh unit in order to sustain a user. The present invention provides novel multi-port safety quick disconnect 15 to permit replacement breathing component 20 A to be safely and quickly connected to mouthpiece 10 without “breaking the seal”, so that additional breathing capacity can be safely supplied to the user when necessary [0048] Safety disconnect 15 is shown in greater detail in FIGS. 5-11. Safety disconnect 15 generally comprises a hollow rectangular valve body 45 having a top opening 48 for connecting to mouthpiece 10 , two faces 50 , 55 ( FIGS. 6 and 9 ) with ports 60 , 65 formed therein, respectively, and a back plate 67 for closing off valve body 45. The faces 50 , 55 are each configured with a U-shaped rail 70 for slidably receiving, and forming an airtight seal with, a component interface 75 which connects with a breathing component. A cylindrical valve spool 80 , with an L-shaped channel 85 formed therein, is rotatably disposed within valve body 45. A selection knob 90 is provided to permit the user to adjust the rotational position of valve spool 80 within valve body 45. As a result of this construction, L-shaped channel 85 can be used to connect port 60 with opening 48 or, alternatively, port 65 with opening 48. [0049] Significantly, means are provided for restricting the position of valve spool 80 within valve body 45 , and for restricting the inadvertent removal of a component interface 75 from valve body 45 , whereby to present a user from accidentally breathing ambient air. [0050] More particularly, back plate 67 includes a locking clip 95 having a pair of projecting spring fingers 100. Valve spool 80 includes four recesses 105 formed therein for selectively receiving spring fingers 100 of locking clip 95. As a result of this construction, valve spool 80 may not be rotated within valve body 45 unless, and until, two component interfaces 75 are pressed sufficiently rearwardly within U-shaped rail 70 as to push the two corresponding projecting spring fingers 100 out of their corresponding spool recesses 105. [0051] Furthermore, selection knob 90 is provided with a peripheral extension 110 along a portion of its perimeter which prevents accidental removal of the component interface 75 selected by and in use on that corresponding side of the valve body so as to prevent the user accidentally disconnecting the active breathing air supply and exposing the corresponding port 60 , 65 to atmosphere. [0052] In addition to the foregoing, valve spool 80 is formed so that when it is in a locked position (i.e., so that a spring finger 100 is received in a spool recess 105 ), L-shaped channel 85 is connecting either port 60 with opening 48 or port 65 with opening 48. [0053] As a result of this construction, a component interface 75 may only be withdrawn when another component interface 75 has been connected to quick disconnect 15 and valve knob 90 has been rotated to select the side being retained as a breathing source. Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. 12-14 , only one port 60 , 65 may be open at any given time to mouthpiece 10. Thus, the mouthpiece can never be opened to ambient air. As a result, multi-port safety quick disconnect 15 permits a replacement breathing component to be safely and quickly connected to mouthpiece 10 without “breaking the seal”, so that additional breathing capacity can be safely supplied to the user. In other words, a user cannot disconnect from a current breathing component unless, and until, a replacement breathing component has been properly connected to multi-port quick disconnect 15. Thus, the construction quick disconnect 15 prohibits a user from (i) accidentally disengaging a current breathing component until a replacement breathing component has been connected, and (ii) inadvertently connecting the mouthpiece to ambient air. [0054] In other words, the foregoing construction permits a first breathing component is to be safely and readily replaced with a replacement breathing component when necessary. More particularly, and looking now at FIGS. 15-18 , safety quick disconnect 15 permits a first breathing component 20 to be replaced with a replacement breathing component 20 A, and the first breathing component 20 to be thereafter discarded. [0055] Looking next at FIGS. 18-21 , it will be seen that quick disconnect 15 can be rotatably positioned in a variety of a configurations vis-à-vis breathing component 20 so as to provide a desired profile, e.g., so as to facilitate wearing on a belt, attachment to alternative breathing component, etc. Furthermore, breathing component 20 can have an ergonomic exterior shape so as to facilitate wearing it on a belt, e.g., the body of breathing component 20 can have a kidney-shaped cross-section and counterlung 35 can have a flat shape (when empty), etc.'.\n",

No. 60/965,464, filed Aug. 20, 2007 by Paul A. Chambers for UNIVERSAL MINER SELF RESCUER (UMSR) (Attorney&#39;s Docket No. CHAMB-13 PROV). [0005] The three above-identified patent applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0006] This invention relates to self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBAs) in general, and more particularly to a self-contained breathing apparatus with a safety quick disconnect for permitting safe and ready access to a replacement breathing component. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0007] The nature of underground mining operations makes them highly dangerous. [0008] For example, in the case of a mine collapse, the supply of breathable air can be severely compromised, placing the miners in great danger. [0009] Furthermore, mines are often highly susceptible to the infusion of noxious gases (e.g., methane, carbon monoxide, etc.). This situation can occur in many scenarios, even where there is no catastrophic mine collapse. Gas pockets can be exposed at any time and without notice, and can be life-threatening even where the mine is structurally intact. In any of these situations, once the gas enters the space occupied by the miners, their lives are in serious danger. [0010] In all of these situations, the miners must quickly recognize the danger and then must obtain an supply of breathable air. This supply of breathable air may be provided by various means, e.g., a filtered system, a conventional “open-loop” self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), a conventional “closed-loop” self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), a solid state oxygen generator, etc. The equipment for providing the supply of breathable air is commonly referred to as a Self Rescuer and is generally carried by the miners on their belts. Once the miners have “switched over” to this supply of breathable air, they must then escape the danger zone. In the case of a “benign” gas pocket, escape may be as simple as walking or riding a mine car out of the affected area. In the case of a mine collapse, gas explosion, or other serious event, escape may involve crawling, tunneling, walking or just waiting for rescue. In any of these latter situations, there is a significant danger that the supply of breathable air may be depleted before the miner has reached a safe location. [0011] At the same time, in many of these situations, it is not possible for the miners to use conventional negative pressure filtered respirators, powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), etc. due to the nature of the threat, e.g., the possible air contaminants (e.g., some gases), the physical state of the ambient air (e.g., super-heated air), etc. In these situations, a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is required. [0012] Conventional “open-loop” SCBA units generally consist of a tank of compressed gas (usually ambient, but filtered, air) with the flow controlled by a regulator or demand valve. One of the major inefficiencies of these units is that the exhausted and/or exhaled air (still containing significant usable oxygen) is vented to the environment and thus lost to the user. Much greater efficiencies (translating into smaller, lighter units and longer supply times) can be attained by using “closed loop” SCBA units which recycle the exhaust air and recover the oxygen, and/or remove the undesirable products of respiration (mainly carbon dioxide). A device utilizing this approach is commonly referred as a “Rebreather”. See FIG. 1. [0013] Any respirator device, whether filtered, open-loop SCBA, closed-loop SCBA, etc. has a limited capacity to supply breathable air. If the miners exhaust the capacity of the respirator device while still in a dangerous environment, the miners must be able to access a replacement breathing component and make the “change-over” to the replacement breathing component without “breaking the seal” or otherwise exposing themselves to breathing in the potentially noxious gases. [0014] As a result, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) which is able to safely and quickly connect to a replacement breathing component without “breaking the seal” so that the replacement breathing component can supply additional breathing capacity to the user. Preferably, the replacement breathing component can take any number of forms, e.g., the working portion of another “closed-loop” SCBA, an air bottle, a carbon monoxide filter respirator, etc. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0015] The present invention provides a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) which is able to safely and quickly connect to a replacement breathing component without “breaking the seal” so that the replacement breathing component can supply additional breathing capacity to the user. [0016] In one form of the present invention, there is provided a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) comprising: [0017] a mouthpiece; [0018] a breathing component for providing breathable air, the breathing component comprising a component interface; and [0019] a safety quick disconnect comprising: a valve body defining: an internal chamber; an opening communicating with the internal chamber and connectable with the mouthpiece; first and second ports communicating with the internal chamber; first and second mounts formed on the body adjacent to the first and second ports, respectively, for receiving the component interface of the breathing component, the first and second mounts being configured so as to place the breathing component into communication with the internal chamber when the component interface is in engagement with one or the other of the first and second mounts; a valve spool selectively rotatably disposed within the internal chamber, wherein the valve spool comprises an L-shaped channel formed such that when the valve spool is appropriately rotated, the L-shaped channel (i) places the opening in communication with the first port, or (ii) places the opening in communication with the second port; and a lock mechanism for (i) preventing the valve spool from being rotated unless the component interface of the breathing component is positioned in one of the first and second mounts and a component interface of a replacement breathing component is positioned in the other of the first and second mounts, and (ii) preventing the removal of a component interface from a mount adjacent to a port which is in communication with the opening.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0041] Looking next at FIGS. 2 and 3 , there is shown a novel self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) 5 formed in accordance with the present invention. SCBA 5 generally comprises a mouthpiece 10 which is releasably connected to a multi-port safety quick disconnect 15. Also connected to quick disconnect 15 is a breathing component 20. A replacement breathing component 20 A may also be connected to quick disconnect 15 when breathing component 20 is to be replaced. [0042] Looking now at FIGS. 2-4 , breathing component 20 preferably comprises a demand regulator 25 , a carbon dioxide scrubber 30 and a counterlung 35. Breathing component 20 also comprises an oxygen supply 40. [0043] During use, the user places mouthpiece 10 in their mouth and inhales and exhales through their mouth (a noseclip may also be supplied to restrict breathing through the nose and permit breathing through only the mouth). As air is exhaled, it passes through demand regulator 25 , through carbon dioxide scrubber 30 and fills counterlung 35. As this occurs, carbon dioxide scrubber 30 purges carbon dioxide from the exhaled air. Conversely, as air is inhaled, air is drawn from counterlung 35 , through carbon dioxide scrubber 30 , through demand regulator 25 and back into the lungs of the user. Again, as the air from counterlung 35 passes through carbon dioxide scrubber 30 , the scrubber purges carbon dioxide from the air. [0044] Demand regulator 25 monitors the air pressure in the system and, when the air pressure falls below a certain threshold, releases supplemental oxygen from oxygen supply 40. More particularly, as the user breathes, the body metabolizes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is then removed from the system by carbon dioxide scrubber 30. Therefore, in a “closed-loop” system, as the user breathes, oxygen is consumed by the user, carbon dioxide is consumed by the scrubber, and the quantity of air is reduced. To that end, demand regulator 25 monitors the air pressure in the system and, as the quantity of air is reduced during breathing and scrubbing (which also reflects a reduction in the quantity of oxygen available for breathing), demand regulator 25 releases supplemental oxygen to the system to compensate for the consumed gases. [0045] As a result of this construction, breathing component 20 is designed to provide extended breathing capacity, due to the use of (i) carbon dioxide scrubber 30 , which allows the re-breathing of exhaled air, and (ii) demand regulator 25 and oxygen supply 40 , which supply supplemental oxygen to the system as oxygen is consumed through breathing. [0046] Significantly, counterlung 35 is carefully configured so as to have a size approximately equal to tidal volume of a pair of human lungs. This is approximately three times smaller than traditional counterlungs. By configuring counterlung 35 with this unique size, breathing component 20 ensures that demand regulator 25 will release fresh oxygen to the system before the oxygen content of the air being re-breathed falls to a level which is too low to safely sustain the user. More particularly, with each breath of the user, approximately 20% of the oxygen inhaled is consumed by the body and is replaced with exhaled carbon dioxide. This exhaled carbon dioxide is in turn purged by carbon dioxide scrubber 30. Thus, in the absence of a supplemental oxygen source, as the user breathes, the total quantity of air will continuously decrease as the carbon dioxide is pulled from the air. If counterlung 35 is made too large, it will take too long for the quantity of air in the system to be depleted to the point where demand regulator 25 will trigger the release of supplemental oxygen from oxygen supply 40. On the other hand, if counterlung 35 is formed too small, a user will not be able to inhale and exhale a full breath, which is important in emergency breathing situations where the user may need to be moving about rapidly. Sizing counterlung 35 so as to be the approximately the size of the tidal volume of a pair of lungs is a new and significant advance in the art. [0047] In another significant advance over the prior art, SCBA 5 utilizes a multi-port safety quick disconnect 15 to permit replacement breathing component 20 A to be safely and quickly connected to mouthpiece 10 without “breaking the seal”, so that additional breathing capacity can be safely supplied to the user when necessary. More particularly, any breathing component (e.g., a “closed-loop” SCBA system, a carbon dioxide absorber, an oxygen tank, etc.) has a finite functional lifetime: at the end of that functional lifetime, the breathing component must ultimately be replaced with a fresh unit in order to sustain a user. The present invention provides novel multi-port safety quick disconnect 15 to permit replacement breathing component 20 A to be safely and quickly connected to mouthpiece 10 without “breaking the seal”, so that additional breathing capacity can be safely supplied to the user when necessary [0048] Safety disconnect 15 is shown in greater detail in FIGS. 5-11. Safety disconnect 15 generally comprises a hollow rectangular valve body 45 having a top opening 48 for connecting to mouthpiece 10 , two faces 50 , 55 ( FIGS. 6 and 9 ) with ports 60 , 65 formed therein, respectively, and a back plate 67 for closing off valve body 45. The faces 50 , 55 are each configured with a U-shaped rail 70 for slidably receiving, and forming an airtight seal with, a component interface 75 which connects with a breathing component. A cylindrical valve spool 80 , with an L-shaped channel 85 formed therein, is rotatably disposed within valve body 45. A selection knob 90 is provided to permit the user to adjust the rotational position of valve spool 80 within valve body 45. As a result of this construction, L-shaped channel 85 can be used to connect port 60 with opening 48 or, alternatively, port 65 with opening 48. [0049] Significantly, means are provided for restricting the position of valve spool 80 within valve body 45 , and for restricting the inadvertent removal of a component interface 75 from valve body 45 , whereby to present a user from accidentally breathing ambient air. [0050] More particularly, back plate 67 includes a locking clip 95 having a pair of projecting spring fingers 100. Valve spool 80 includes four recesses 105 formed therein for selectively receiving spring fingers 100 of locking clip 95. As a result of this construction, valve spool 80 may not be rotated within valve body 45 unless, and until, two component interfaces 75 are pressed sufficiently rearwardly within U-shaped rail 70 as to push the two corresponding projecting spring fingers 100 out of their corresponding spool recesses 105. [0051] Furthermore, selection knob 90 is provided with a peripheral extension 110 along a portion of its perimeter which prevents accidental removal of the component interface 75 selected by and in use on that corresponding side of the valve body so as to prevent the user accidentally disconnecting the active breathing air supply and exposing the corresponding port 60 , 65 to atmosphere. [0052] In addition to the foregoing, valve spool 80 is formed so that when it is in a locked position (i.e., so that a spring finger 100 is received in a spool recess 105 ), L-shaped channel 85 is connecting either port 60 with opening 48 or port 65 with opening 48. [0053] As a result of this construction, a component interface 75 may only be withdrawn when another component interface 75 has been connected to quick disconnect 15 and valve knob 90 has been rotated to select the side being retained as a breathing source. Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. 12-14 , only one port 60 , 65 may be open at any given time to mouthpiece 10. Thus, the mouthpiece can never be opened to ambient air. As a result, multi-port safety quick disconnect 15 permits a replacement breathing component to be safely and quickly connected to mouthpiece 10 without “breaking the seal”, so that additional breathing capacity can be safely supplied to the user. In other words, a user cannot disconnect from a current breathing component unless, and until, a replacement breathing component has been properly connected to multi-port quick disconnect 15.

More particularly, and looking now at FIGS. 15-18 , safety quick disconnect 15 permits a first breathing component 20 to be replaced with a replacement breathing component 20 A, and the first breathing component 20 to be thereafter discarded. [0055] Looking next at FIGS. 18-21 , it will be seen that quick disconnect 15 can be rotatably positioned in a variety of a configurations vis-à-vis breathing component 20 so as to provide a desired profile, e.g., so as to facilitate wearing on a belt, attachment to alternative breathing component, etc. Furthermore, breathing component 20 can have an ergonomic exterior shape so as to facilitate wearing it on a belt, e.g., the body of breathing component 20 can have a kidney-shaped cross-section and counterlung 35 can have a flat shape (when empty), etc.'.\n",

[0009] Furthermore, mines are often highly susceptible to the infusion of noxious gases (e.g., methane, carbon monoxide, etc.). This situation can occur in many scenarios, even where there is no catastrophic mine collapse. Gas pockets can be exposed at any time and without notice, and can be life-threatening even where the mine is structurally intact. In any of these situations, once the gas enters the space occupied by the miners, their lives are in serious danger. [0010] In all of these situations, the miners must quickly recognize the danger and then must obtain an supply of breathable air. This supply of breathable air may be provided by various means, e.g., a filtered system, a conventional “open-loop” self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), a conventional “closed-loop” self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), a solid state oxygen generator, etc. The equipment for providing the supply of breathable air is commonly referred to as a Self Rescuer and is generally carried by the miners on their belts. Once the miners have “switched over” to this supply of breathable air, they must then escape the danger zone. In the case of a “benign” gas pocket, escape may be as simple as walking or riding a mine car out of the affected area. In the case of a mine collapse, gas explosion, or other serious event, escape may involve crawling, tunneling, walking or just waiting for rescue. In any of these latter situations, there is a significant danger that the supply of breathable air may be depleted before the miner has reached a safe location. [0011] At the same time, in many of these situations, it is not possible for the miners to use conventional negative pressure filtered respirators, powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), etc. due to the nature of the threat, e.g., the possible air contaminants (e.g., some gases), the physical state of the ambient air (e.g., super-heated air), etc. In these situations, a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is required. [0012] Conventional “open-loop” SCBA units generally consist of a tank of compressed gas (usually ambient, but filtered, air) with the flow controlled by a regulator or demand valve. One of the major inefficiencies of these units is that the exhausted and/or exhaled air (still containing significant usable oxygen) is vented to the environment and thus lost to the user. Much greater efficiencies (translating into smaller, lighter units and longer supply times) can be attained by using “closed loop” SCBA units which recycle the exhaust air and recover the oxygen, and/or remove the undesirable products of respiration (mainly carbon dioxide). A device utilizing this approach is commonly referred as a “Rebreather”. See FIG. 1. [0013] Any respirator device, whether filtered, open-loop SCBA, closed-loop SCBA, etc. has a limited capacity to supply breathable air. If the miners exhaust the capacity of the respirator device while still in a dangerous environment, the miners must be able to access a replacement breathing component and make the “change-over” to the replacement breathing component without “breaking the seal” or otherwise exposing themselves to breathing in the potentially noxious gases. [0014] As a result, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) which is able to safely and quickly connect to a replacement breathing component without “breaking the seal” so that the replacement breathing component can supply additional breathing capacity to the user. Preferably, the replacement breathing component can take any number of forms, e.g., the working portion of another “closed-loop” SCBA, an air bottle, a carbon monoxide filter respirator, etc. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0015] The present invention provides a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) which is able to safely and quickly connect to a replacement breathing component without “breaking the seal” so that the replacement breathing component can supply additional breathing capacity to the user. [0016] In one form of the present invention, there is provided a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) comprising: [0017] a mouthpiece; [0018] a breathing component for providing breathable air, the breathing component comprising a component interface; and [0019] a safety quick disconnect comprising: a valve body defining: an internal chamber; an opening communicating with the internal chamber and connectable with the mouthpiece; first and second ports communicating with the internal chamber; first and second mounts formed on the body adjacent to the first and second ports, respectively, for receiving the component interface of the breathing component, the first and second mounts being configured so as to place the breathing component into communication with the internal chamber when the component interface is in engagement with one or the other of the first and second mounts; a valve spool selectively rotatably disposed within the internal chamber, wherein the valve spool comprises an L-shaped channel formed such that when the valve spool is appropriately rotated, the L-shaped channel (i) places the opening in communication with the first port, or (ii) places the opening in communication with the second port; and a lock mechanism for (i) preventing the valve spool from being rotated unless the component interface of the breathing component is positioned in one of the first and second mounts and a component interface of a replacement breathing component is positioned in the other of the first and second mounts, and (ii) preventing the removal of a component interface from a mount adjacent to a port which is in communication with the opening. [0027] In another form of the present invention, there is provided a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) comprising: [0028] a mouthpiece; [0029] a counterlung; and [0030] a breathing component interposed between the mouthpiece and the counterlung, the breathing component being adapted to provide breathable air; wherein the counterlung is sized so as to have a volume which is approximately equal to the tidal volume of a pair of adult lungs. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0031] These and other objects and features of the present invention will be more fully disclosed or rendered obvious by the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, which are to be considered together with the accompanying drawings wherein like numbers refer to like elements and further wherein: [0032] FIG. 1 is a schematic view showing a prior art SCBA; [0033] FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing a high-level overview of a novel SCBA formed in accordance with the present invention; [0034] FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing a more detailed illustration of a novel SCBA formed in accordance with the present invention; [0035] FIG. 4 is a schematic view showing a novel breathing component formed in accordance with the present invention; [0036] FIGS. 5-11 are schematic views showing a novel safety quick disconnect of the present invention; [0037] FIGS. 12-14 are schematic views illustrating how a breathing component and a replacement breathing component may be simultaneously connected to the safety quick disconnect, with only one breathing component being operable at a given time; [0038] FIGS. 15-17 are schematic views showing how a depleted breathing component may be “switched out” (i.e., changed over) to a replacement breathing component; [0039] FIGS. 18-23 are schematic views illustrating various configurations for a novel breathing component formed in accordance with the present invention; and [0040] FIGS. 24-27 are schematic views illustrating various types of breathing components which can be connected to the safety quick disconnect. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0041] Looking next at FIGS. 2 and 3 , there is shown a novel self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) 5 formed in accordance with the present invention. SCBA 5 generally comprises a mouthpiece 10 which is releasably connected to a multi-port safety quick disconnect 15. Also connected to quick disconnect 15 is a breathing component 20. A replacement breathing component 20 A may also be connected to quick disconnect 15 when breathing component 20 is to be replaced. [0042] Looking now at FIGS. 2-4 , breathing component 20 preferably comprises a demand regulator 25 , a carbon dioxide scrubber 30 and a counterlung 35. Breathing component 20 also comprises an oxygen supply 40. [0043] During use, the user places mouthpiece 10 in their mouth and inhales and exhales through their mouth (a noseclip may also be supplied to restrict breathing through the nose and permit breathing through only the mouth). As air is exhaled, it passes through demand regulator 25 , through carbon dioxide scrubber 30 and fills counterlung 35. As this occurs, carbon dioxide scrubber 30 purges carbon dioxide from the exhaled air. Conversely, as air is inhaled, air is drawn from counterlung 35 , through carbon dioxide scrubber 30 , through demand regulator 25 and back into the lungs of the user. Again, as the air from counterlung 35 passes through carbon dioxide scrubber 30 , the scrubber purges carbon dioxide from the air. [0044] Demand regulator 25 monitors the air pressure in the system and, when the air pressure falls below a certain threshold, releases supplemental oxygen from oxygen supply 40. More particularly, as the user breathes, the body metabolizes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is then removed from the system by carbon dioxide scrubber 30. Therefore, in a “closed-loop” system, as the user breathes, oxygen is consumed by the user, carbon dioxide is consumed by the scrubber, and the quantity of air is reduced. To that end, demand regulator 25 monitors the air pressure in the system and, as the quantity of air is reduced during breathing and scrubbing (which also reflects a reduction in the quantity of oxygen available for breathing), demand regulator 25 releases supplemental oxygen to the system to compensate for the consumed gases. [0045] As a result of this construction, breathing component 20 is designed to provide extended breathing capacity, due to the use of (i) carbon dioxide scrubber 30 , which allows the re-breathing of exhaled air, and (ii) demand regulator 25 and oxygen supply 40 , which supply supplemental oxygen to the system as oxygen is consumed through breathing. [0046] Significantly, counterlung 35 is carefully configured so as to have a size approximately equal to tidal volume of a pair of human lungs. This is approximately three times smaller than traditional counterlungs. By configuring counterlung 35 with this unique size, breathing component 20 ensures that demand regulator 25 will release fresh oxygen to the system before the oxygen content of the air being re-breathed falls to a level which is too low to safely sustain the user. More particularly, with each breath of the user, approximately 20% of the oxygen inhaled is consumed by the body and is replaced with exhaled carbon dioxide. This exhaled carbon dioxide is in turn purged by carbon dioxide scrubber 30. Thus, in the absence of a supplemental oxygen source, as the user breathes, the total quantity of air will continuously decrease as the carbon dioxide is pulled from the air. If counterlung 35 is made too large, it will take too long for the quantity of air in the system to be depleted to the point where demand regulator 25 will trigger the release of supplemental oxygen from oxygen supply 40. On the other hand, if counterlung 35 is formed too small, a user will not be able to inhale and exhale a full breath, which is important in emergency breathing situations where the user may need to be moving about rapidly. Sizing counterlung 35 so as to be the approximately the size of the tidal volume of a pair of lungs is a new and significant advance in the art. [0047] In another significant advance over the prior art, SCBA 5 utilizes a multi-port safety quick disconnect 15 to permit replacement breathing component 20 A to be safely and quickly connected to mouthpiece 10 without “breaking the seal”, so that additional breathing capacity can be safely supplied to the user when necessary. More particularly, any breathing component (e.g., a “closed-loop” SCBA system, a carbon dioxide absorber, an oxygen tank, etc.) has a finite functional lifetime: at the end of that functional lifetime, the breathing component must ultimately be replaced with a fresh unit in order to sustain a user. The present invention provides novel multi-port safety quick disconnect 15 to permit replacement breathing component 20 A to be safely and quickly connected to mouthpiece 10 without “breaking the seal”, so that additional breathing capacity can be safely supplied to the user when necessary [0048] Safety disconnect 15 is shown in greater detail in FIGS. 5-11. Safety disconnect 15 generally comprises a hollow rectangular valve body 45 having a top opening 48 for connecting to mouthpiece 10 , two faces 50 , 55 ( FIGS. 6 and 9 ) with ports 60 , 65 formed therein, respectively, and a back plate 67 for closing off valve body 45. The faces 50 , 55 are each configured with a U-shaped rail 70 for slidably receiving, and forming an airtight seal with, a component interface 75 which connects with a breathing component. A cylindrical valve spool 80 , with an L-shaped channel 85 formed therein, is rotatably disposed within valve body 45. A selection knob 90 is provided to permit the user to adjust the rotational position of valve spool 80 within valve body 45. As a result of this construction, L-shaped channel 85 can be used to connect port 60 with opening 48 or, alternatively, port 65 with opening 48. [0049] Significantly, means are provided for restricting the position of valve spool 80 within valve body 45 , and for restricting the inadvertent removal of a component interface 75 from valve body 45 , whereby to present a user from accidentally breathing ambient air. [0050] More particularly, back plate 67 includes a locking clip 95 having a pair of projecting spring fingers 100. Valve spool 80 includes four recesses 105 formed therein for selectively receiving spring fingers 100 of locking clip 95. As a result of this construction, valve spool 80 may not be rotated within valve body 45 unless, and until, two component interfaces 75 are pressed sufficiently rearwardly within U-shaped rail 70 as to push the two corresponding projecting spring fingers 100 out of their corresponding spool recesses 105. [0051] Furthermore, selection knob 90 is provided with a peripheral extension 110 along a portion of its perimeter which prevents accidental removal of the component interface 75 selected by and in use on that corresponding side of the valve body so as to prevent the user accidentally disconnecting the active breathing air supply and exposing the corresponding port 60 , 65 to atmosphere. [0052] In addition to the foregoing, valve spool 80 is formed so that when it is in a locked position (i.e., so that a spring finger 100 is received in a spool recess 105 ), L-shaped channel 85 is connecting either port 60 with opening 48 or port 65 with opening 48. [0053] As a result of this construction, a component interface 75 may only be withdrawn when another component interface 75 has been connected to quick disconnect 15 and valve knob 90 has been rotated to select the side being retained as a breathing source. Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. 12-14 , only one port 60 , 65 may be open at any given time to mouthpiece 10. Thus, the mouthpiece can never be opened to ambient air. As a result, multi-port safety quick disconnect 15 permits a replacement breathing component to be safely and quickly connected to mouthpiece 10 without “breaking the seal”, so that additional breathing capacity can be safely supplied to the user. In other words, a user cannot disconnect from a current breathing component unless, and until, a replacement breathing component has been properly connected to multi-port quick disconnect 15. Thus, the construction quick disconnect 15 prohibits a user from (i) accidentally disengaging a current breathing component until a replacement breathing component has been connected, and (ii) inadvertently connecting the mouthpiece to ambient air. [0054] In other words, the foregoing construction permits a first breathing component is to be safely and readily replaced with a replacement breathing component when necessary. More particularly, and looking now at FIGS. 15-18 , safety quick disconnect 15 permits a first breathing component 20 to be replaced with a replacement breathing component 20 A, and the first breathing component 20 to be thereafter discarded. [0055] Looking next at FIGS. 18-21 , it will be seen that quick disconnect 15 can be rotatably positioned in a variety of a configurations vis-à-vis breathing component 20 so as to provide a desired profile, e.g., so as to facilitate wearing on a belt, attachment to alternative breathing component, etc. Furthermore, breathing component 20 can have an ergonomic exterior shape so as to facilitate wearing it on a belt, e.g., the body of breathing component 20 can have a kidney-shaped cross-section and counterlung 35 can have a flat shape (when empty), etc.'.\n",

      "Changed 'container' by 'surface' in 'TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates generally to liquid containers or vessels having rims surrounding a large opening and, more particularly, to an aid adapted to engage the rim and enable the user to drink liquid from the container. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION When a child finishes the cereal in his or her breakfast bowl, milk often remains in the bowl. The child would like to drink, or “slurp,” the remaining milk. To do so, the child tilts the bowl to his or her mouth. This action typically causes spillage, because the milk exits the bowl both into and not into the child&#39;s mouth. Adults face a similar dilemma when they attempt to drink soup or other beverages from a wide-mouth bowl or other fluid container or vessel having a large opening. A number of attachments are known to facilitate drinking of a liquid, such as water, soda, beer, or other beverages, from a conventional cup or can having a relatively small opening. The moustache cup adapter disclosed by Miller in U.S. Pat. No. 3,944,11 represents one example. The moustache cup adapter (“adapter”) does not center or funnel the flow of liquid; rather, the adapter blocks and restricts flow, to protect the mustache, except for the aperture defined by opening 3. Element 1 of the adapter is a segmental-shaped, flat, thin, plastic plane without walls to direct flow. Other devices are known to engage fluid containers or vessels having a large opening to facilitate drinking of the fluid. U.S. Pat. No. Des. 373,050 illustrates one example of such a device. Brewer et al. show a straw penetrating both the rim of the container and an upper region of the side wall of the container. One end of the straw sits adjacent the bottom of the bowl, enabling the user to drink at least most of the fluid from the container. This device requires a specially manufactured bowl: one having aligned holes in both its rim and side wall. In addition, the relatively small opening of the straw limits the amount of liquid that the device can transfer during a specified period of time and, therefore, the speed at which the user can drink. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing devices, a new rim-mounted drinking aid for liquid containers is provided. An object of the present invention is to provide an easily manufactured drinking aid that engages conventional containers without requiring any modification to the container. A related object is to provide a drinking aid that easily slips onto the rim of a container where it is adequately held in place. Other related objects are to provide a flexible drinking aid that engages the container via a combination of spring and frictional forces and a drinking aid constructed so that it conforms to and fits tightly on the rim of the container. Still other objects of the present invention are to provide an effective seal with the associated container and to prevent spillage when the user drinks from the container. An additional object is to provide a drinking aid that centers or funnels the flow of liquid from the container and toward the mouth of the user. Yet another object is to permit rapid, substantially spill-free transfer of large quantities (certainly relative to conventional straws) of liquid from a container. It is still another object of the present invention to assure that the drinking aid can be easily removed from the container, cleaned, and reused. An additional object is to render the drinking aid readily adaptable for use with containers of slightly different size, and able to readily conform to irregularities in the configuration of the container. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION To achieve these and other objects, and in view of its purposes, the present invention provides a drinking aid adapted to engage, and facilitate drinking by a user from, a liquid container having a rim and an opening. The drinking aid has a body at least a portion of which defines a U-shaped groove adapted to receive the rim of the container when the rim slips into the groove and to create a mechanical engagement between the rim and the drinking aid. The body also engages the container to create a frictional fit between the drinking aid and the container. At least one of a column or angled arms disposed on the body form a V-shaped or U-shaped funnel directing and centering fluid from the container to an orifice either formed in the column or defined by the angled arms. The drinking aid prevents spillage of the liquid from the container when the user tilts the container to pour liquid through the orifice. The present invention also encompasses a kit. The kit includes two components. The first component is a liquid container having a rim and an opening. The second component is the drinking aid as defined above. In one specific embodiment, the invention is a drinking aid adapted to engage, and facilitate drinking by a user from, a liquid container having a rim, an outside wall, and an opening. The drinking aid has a body defining a U-shaped groove adapted to receive the rim of the container when the rim slips into the groove and to create a mechanical engagement between the rim and the drinking aid, the body also engaging the container to create a frictional fit between the drinking aid and the container. A leg of the drinking aid extends downward from the body and is adapted to engage the outside wall of the container to stabilize the drinking aid on the container. A neck extends upward from the body and transitions to a column that forms a V-shaped or U-shaped funnel directing and centering fluid from the container to an orifice centrally formed by angled sides in the column. A curved lip is disposed on the end of the column opposite the neck, the lip helping to prevent spillage of the liquid from the container when the user tilts the container to pour liquid out the opening and through the orifice. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary, but are not restrictive, of the invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The invention is best understood from the following detailed description when read in connection with the accompanying drawing. It is emphasized that, according to common practice, the various features of the drawing are not to scale. On the contrary, the dimensions of the various features are arbitrarily expanded or reduced for clarity. Included in the drawing are the following figures: FIG. 1 is a top view of a first embodiment of the drinking aid according to the present invention; FIG. 2 is a front view of the drinking aid shown in FIG. 1 ; FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken along the line 3 - 3 of FIG. 2 ; FIG. 4 is a left-side perspective view of the drinking aid shown in FIGS. 1-3 ; FIG. 5 is a right-side perspective view of the drinking aid shown in FIGS. 1-4 ; FIG. 6 is an isometric view of a second embodiment of the drinking aid according to the present invention, shown before application to a liquid container; FIG. 7 is an isometric view of the drinking aid shown in FIG. 6 , shown as it is shaped upon application to a liquid container; FIG. 8 is top view of the drinking aid shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 ; FIG. 9 is a front view of the drinking aid shown in FIGS. 6 , 7 , and 8 ; FIG. 10 is a cross-sectional view taken along the line 10 - 10 of FIG. 9 ; FIG. 11 is a top view of a conventional liquid container with the first embodiment of the drinking aid in position on the rim of the container according to the present invention; and FIG. 12 is a side view of the liquid container and drinking aid as shown in FIG. 11. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring now to the drawing, in which like reference numbers refer to like elements throughout the various figures that comprise the drawing, FIG. 1 shows a top view of a first embodiment of the drinking aid 10 according to the present invention. Although it may be sized to fit any conventional liquid container 100 having a rim 102 surrounding a large opening 104 , as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12 , a typical length for drinking aid 10 is about 4 inches. Container 100 may be any conventional china, glassware, or paper serving vessel. Examples of container 100 include bowls, cups, or other receptacles, and especially include beverage or other liquid containers. Drinking aid 10 is molded from plastic as one, integral, monolithic, unit. A non-toxic, recyclable material such as low-density polyethylene is a suitable plastic material of manufacture. Although other materials are suitable, the material of manufacture for drinking aid 10 must be resilient and flexible to allow drinking aid 10 to (1) engage rim 102 of container 100 ; (2) fit onto containers of various sizes; and (3) readily conform to irregularities in the configuration of container 100. The material permits drinking aid 10 to be cleaned, sterilized, or sanitized and reused (e.g., drinking aid 10 is dishwasher safe). Although a flexible plastic material is preferred, it is also possible to manufacture drinking aid 10 from a semi-hard material that fits containers of a definite size or shape. It is possible, too, to manufacture drinking aid 10 from a disposable material. Geometrically, drinking aid 10 has an annular shape adapted to correspond to that of container 100. Drinking aid 10 extends only partially around the circumference of container 100 and is typically aligned along an arc (“ARC”) of about 100 degrees with a radius of curvature R 2 from the annulus center C of about 2.55 inches. As most clearly illustrated in the cross section of FIG. 3 , drinking aid 10 has a U-shaped body 12 defining an annular groove 14. A lower leg 16 extends downward from body 12. Projecting upward from body 12 is a neck 18 , which transitions to a column 20 ending in a lip 22. Exemplary dimensions suitable for drinking aid 10 are provided in FIG. 3. Both ends of column 20 and lip 22 have a beveled edge 24 for comfort and ease of use. Beveled edge 24 also avoids sharp corners and the corresponding risk that drinking aid 10 might catch on other objects. Column 20 has a radius of curvature R 1 from the annulus center C of about 2.31 inches. Centered in column 20 is an orifice 30 defined by angled sides 28. Angled sides 28 give orifice 30 a V-shaped funnel design, with a typical angle (“A”) of about 67 degrees (see FIG. 2 ). FIGS. 4 and 5 are respectively a left-side and a right-side perspective view of drinking aid 10. These figures show that drinking aid 10 is bilaterally symmetrical about the center of orifice 30. As illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12 , drinking aid 10 easily slips onto rim 102 of any liquid container 100. More specifically, the user grasps drinking aid 10 and pushes drinking aid 10 toward rim 102 with rim 102 aligned between leg 16 and neck 18. Given the resiliency of drinking aid 10 , this action separates leg 16 from neck 18 so that rim 102 slips into groove 14. Thus, assembly of drinking aid 10 onto container 100 involves a simple sliding motion and is easily achieved. Once rim 102 is fully in position within groove 14 , as shown best in FIG. 12 , the user releases grasp of drinking aid 10 and is ready to enjoy the liquid in container 100. Drinking aid 10 remains in position on container 100 via (1) a friction force created by the engagement between drinking aid 10 and container 100 , and (2) the spring force provided by the resiliency of drinking aid 10. Leg 16 engages the outside wall of container 100 to provide additional stability. To drink a liquid from container 100 without drinking aid 10 is difficult because the liquid spreads out or expands as the user tilts container 100 and the liquid exits the relatively large opening 104 of the container. The user finds it difficult to center the flow of the liquid as it exits container 100. With drinking aid 10 in position on container 100 , however, the liquid is centered to allow ease of drinking. Drinking aid 10 funnels the liquid to the center of drinking aid 10 where the liquid passes through orifice 30 and to the mouth of the user; drinking aid 10 creates a funnel to direct fluid flow. The V-shaped design includes relatively high angled sides 28 of column 20 on each side of orifice 30 to prevent spillage from liquid-holding container 100 as the user drinks. The curvature of lip 22 also helps to prevent spillage. Drinking aid 10 provides a liquid seal when assembled onto rim 102 of container 100 , allowing liquid to funnel to V-shaped orifice 30 and preventing leakage between drinking aid 10 and rim 102 of container 100. Thus, drinking aid 10 constitutes a spill-resistant, rim-mounted, pouring spout for container 100. After the user has finished drinking the liquid from container 100 , drinking aid 10 can be removed from container 100 , cleaned, and reused. The user simply grasps drinking aid 10 and peels it away from rim 102 of container 100. A relatively slight pull force exerted by the user will overcome the friction and spring forces that otherwise maintain drinking aid 10 on container 100. As the user pulls on drinking aid 10 , leg 16 and neck 18 expand and allow rim 102 to exit groove 14. Once drinking aid 10 is completely removed from container 100 , drinking aid 10 can be cleaned along with other dishes—perhaps in a dishwasher. Thereafter, drinking aid 10 is ready to be reused. FIGS. 6-10 illustrate a second embodiment, namely the drinking aid 50 , according to the present invention. More specifically, FIG. 6 illustrates drinking aid 50 before application to container 100. Drinking aid 50 has a substantially flat body 52 with a front face 54. Provided on front face 54 are a pair of angled arms 56 creating a funnel that ends in a tongue 58 at an orifice 60. As shown best in FIG. 8 , a typical width (“W”) for orifice 60 is between 0.50 and 1.0 inches and, preferably, about 0.75 inches. Such a width permits rapid, substantially spill-free transfer of large quantities (certainly relative to conventional straws) of liquid. FIG. 9 shows that drinking aid 50 has exemplary dimensions including a height (“H”) of about 1 inch and a length (“L”) of about 4 inches. Other exemplary dimensions suitable for drinking aid 50 are provided in FIG. 10. All of these dimensions can be changed, however, to accommodate different containers of particular sizes. In addition, the sizes of particular components of drinking aid 50 may be changed. For example, although the thickness as illustrated in FIG. 10 of tongue 58 is about 0.060 inches (i.e., twice the thickness of body 52 ), tongue 58 and body 52 may have the same thickness (e.g., 0.030 inches). Provided at the top of body 52 and extending opposite front face 54 is an L-shaped hook 62 defining, in combination with the rear face 64 of body 52 , a U-shaped annular groove 66. Hook 62 engages rim 102 of container 100 , with rim 102 engaging groove 66 , to help hold drinking aid 50 onto container 100. To assemble drinking aid 50 on container 100 , the user places drinking aid 50 inside container 100 and bends flexible drinking aid 50 into the position shown in FIG. 7. The elasticity of drinking aid 50 forces rear face 64 of drinking aid 50 to push against the inside wall of container 100. The combination of this spring force with (1) the frictional engagement between drinking aid 50 and container 100 , and (2) the mechanical engagement between hook 62 and rim 102 assures assembly of drinking aid 50 on container 100. With drinking aid 50 in position on and in container 100 , the user can tilt container 100 and drink the liquid from container 100. The liquid is centered by drinking aid 50 to allow ease of drinking. Drinking aid 50 funnels the liquid to the center of drinking aid 50 , directed by angled arms 56 , where the liquid passes through orifice 30 , over tongue 58 , and to the mouth of the user. Thus, drinking aid 50 creates a funnel to direct fluid flow. Drinking aid 50 provides a liquid seal when assembled onto rim 102 of container 100 , allowing liquid to funnel to V-shaped orifice 60 and preventing leakage between drinking aid 50 and rim 102 of container 100. Thus, like the first embodiment of drinking aid 10 , drinking aid 50 constitutes a spill-resistant, rim-mounted, pouring spout for container 100. Also like the first embodiment, drinking aid 50 can be removed from container 100 , cleaned, and reused.

No. 12/261,939, filed Oct. 30, 2008, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/985,489, filed on Nov. 5, 2007 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/991,004, filed on Nov. 29, 2007, the disclosure of each of these three applications incorporated in its entirety by this reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to soft prosthetic implants and, more particularly, to methods of texturing the exterior surface of such implants, for instance breast implants, to produce an open-cell texture on the outer surface. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Implantable prostheses are commonly used to replace or augment body tissue. In the case of breast cancer, it is sometimes necessary to remove some or all of the mammary gland and surrounding tissue, which creates a void that can be filled with an implantable prosthesis. The implant serves to support surrounding tissue and to maintain the appearance of the body. The restoration of the normal appearance of the body has an extremely beneficial psychological effect on post-operative patients, eliminating much of the shock and depression that often follows extensive surgical procedures. Implantable prostheses are also used more generally for restoring the normal appearance of soft tissue in various areas of the body, such as the buttocks, chin, calf, etc. Soft implantable prostheses typically include a relatively thin and quite flexible envelope or shell made of vulcanized (cured) silicone elastomer. The shell is filled either with a silicone gel or with a normal saline solution. The filling of the shell takes place before or after the shell is inserted through an incision in the patient. The development of implants having textured outer surfaces reflects an attempt to prevent the contraction of the fibrous outer capsule that forms around the implant, which tends to render an implant spherical, painful and aesthetically undesirable. Layers of polyether, polyester or polyurethane foam material have been applied to the back sides of mammary prostheses so that fibrous-tissue could grow into the material and thereby anchor prosthesis securely to the chest wall. However, possible problems exist with foam materials, which may degrade in the body over a period of time, and the effectiveness of these materials for preventing capsular contracture may disappear as they degrade. Despite many advances in the construction of soft prosthetic implants, there remains a need for better methods for texturing surfaces of implants. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides processes for forming soft prosthetic implants having textured surfaces and implants formed by said processes. The processes generally comprise the steps of forming a flexible shell, adhering on the exterior of the flexible shell a distribution of rounded particles, curing the flexible shell with the rounded particles adhered thereto, and causing or allowing the rounded particles to be removed from the shell thereby leaving impressions of the particles in the shell to create an open-pored structure on a surface thereof. In one embodiment, the flexible shell is formed of a silicone elastomer. For instance, the flexible shell may be formed of a plurality of layers of different silicone elastomers, or the flexible shell may be formed of a single homogeneous layer of a silicone elastomer. The step of forming the flexible shell may comprise dipping a mandrel into a liquid dispersion of elastomeric material. Alternatively, the step of forming comprises rotational molding. In one embodiment, the step of adhering comprises dipping the flexible shell into a liquid containing the rounded particles, for example, a liquid dispersion or emulsion of rounded particles, for example, rounded salt crystals. Prior to the step of dipping the flexible shell, the process may also include applying a tack coat layer onto the flexible shell. In one aspect, the rounded particles comprise rounded crystals of sodium chloride and the solvent is an aqueous composition, for example, water. In other embodiments, the rounded particles comprise rounded sugar particles. In other embodiments, the rounded particles comprise a suitable solid material which is provided in a rounded particulate form, and which is capable of being adhered to a shell, for example, an uncured elastomer shell, and is capable of being dissolved, for example, using a solvent, thereby leaving open, rounded pores in the shell. In one embodiment, the rounded particles used in accordance with the invention have a substantially uniform particle size of between about 150 microns and about 1450 microns. More specifically, the particles have a maximum particle size range selected from a group of ranges consisting of (1) a range between about 180 microns and about 425 microns, (2) a range between about 425 microns and about 850 microns, and (3) a range between about 850 microns and about 1450 microns. In one embodiment, about 90% of the particles are in the selected particle size range. Another aspect of the invention is a soft prosthetic breast implant, formed by a process comprising the steps of forming a flexible shell of silicone elastomer in the shape of a breast implant, adhering on the exterior of the flexible shell a substantially even distribution of rounded particles, curing the flexible shell with the rounded particles adhered thereto, and exposing the flexible shell to a suitable solvent for a sufficient amount of time to dissolve the rounded particles thereby forming an open-pored structure on the exterior of the flexible shell. In one embodiment, at least one, for example, at least two, for example all three of the physical properties of ultimate break force, ultimate elongation, and ultimate tensile strength of an implant formed in accordance with the present process is superior to an implant made using substantially the same process and the same materials except for conventional angular or non-rounded salt crystals instead of rounded salt crystals. The step of forming the flexible shell may comprise dipping a mandrel into a liquid dispersion of a shell material, or rotational molding. In one embodiment, the step of forming the flexible shell comprises forming a shell with an opening and the process further includes attaching a patch to cover the opening. The patch may be an unvulcanized elastomer and is attached prior to the step of curing. Alternatively, the step of forming the flexible shell comprises forming a shell with an opening and the process further includes attaching valve, for example, a one-way valve to cover the opening. The rounded salt crystals may comprise sodium chloride. A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention are set forth in the following description and claims, particularly when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like parts bear like reference numerals. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Features and advantages of the present invention will become appreciated and the same become better understood with reference to the specification, claims, and appended drawings wherein: FIGS. 1A-1C show several steps in a process of dip-forming the shell of a breast implant prosthesis; FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view through one portion of a textured multi-layered breast implant prosthesis shell; FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view through one portion of a textured single-layer breast implant prosthesis shell; FIG. 4 is a magnified view of a sample of rounded salt crystals used in the implant texturing process of the present invention; FIG. 5 is a magnified view of a sample of cubic salt crystals used in conventional implant texturing processes of the prior art; FIGS. 6A and 6B are cross-sectional and plan views, respectively, of a textured implant of the prior art; FIGS. 7A and 7B are cross-sectional and plan views, respectively, of another textured implant of the prior art; and FIGS. 8A and 8B are cross-sectional and plan views, respectively, of a textured implant in accordance with the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention provides a saline- or gel-filled soft implant for prostheses and tissue expanders. The implant generally comprises a shell, for example, a silicone elastomer shell, with a textured surface. The primary application for such soft implants is to reconstruct or augment the female breast. Other potential applications are implants for the buttocks, testes, or calf, among other body regions. FIGS. 1A-1C illustrate one process for forming flexible implant shells for implantable prostheses and tissue expanders, involving dipping a suitably shaped mandrel 20 into a silicone elastomer dispersion 22. Many such dispersions are used in the field. Basically they contain a silicone elastomer and a solvent. The silicone elastomer is typically polydimethylsiloxane, polydiphenyl-siloxane or some combination of these two elastomers. Typical solvents include xylene or trichloromethane. Different manufacturers vary the type and amount of the ingredients in the dispersion, the viscosity of the dispersion and the solid content of the dispersion. Nonetheless, the present invention is expected to be adaptable to have utility with a wide variety of silicone rubber dispersions. The mandrel 20 is withdrawn from the dispersion and the excess silicone elastomer dispersion is allowed to drain from the mandrel. After the excess dispersion has drained from the mandrel at least a portion of the solvent is allowed to volatilize or evaporate. Normally this is accomplished by flowing air over the coated mandrel at a controlled temperature and humidity. Different manufacturers use various quantities, velocities or directions of air flow and set the temperature and humidity of the air at different values. However, the desired result, driving off the solvent, remains the same. It is also common for prostheses manufacturers to repeat this dip and volatilize procedure a number of times so that a number of layers are built up on the mandrel to reach a desired shell thickness. A layered structure like most current silicone elastomer shells can be made by sequentially dipping the mandrel in different dispersions. Alternatively, the steps may be repeated in a single dispersion 22 so that the finished product is a single homogenous material or layer. That is, the dipping process may be done in multiple stages or steps, each step adding more material, yet the finished product exhibits no distinct layers and the entire shell wall is homogenous or uniform in composition. FIG. 2 illustrates in cross-section a portion of a textured multi-layered implant of the present invention. A primary barrier to fluid passage through the shell wall is provided by an inner barrier layer 30. Two base coat layers 32 , 34 lie radially inward from the barrier layer 30. In some cases a single base coat layer may be used. On the outer side of the barrier layer 30 , three further base coat layers 36 , 38 , 40 are provided, although again a single outer layer may be used. Furthermore, outside of the outer base coat layers 30 - 40 , a tack coat layer 42 , a layer of textured crystals 44 , and an overcoat layer 48 are provided. The absolute thickness of the implant wall may vary but an exemplary average thickness is about 0.456 mm (0.018 inches). The overall thickness of the textured implant wall is somewhat greater than a similar smooth-walled shell because of the extra layers. Alternatively, FIG. 3 illustrates a cross-section of textured single-layered implant shell wall 50 that is a homogeneous silicone elastomer made entirely of a barrier material that sterically retards permeation of the silicone gel through the shell. The outer surface 52 of the barrier layer 50 is textured. The implants made with the single layer 50 may be for implant in the breast such that the entire flexible outer shell is shaped accordingly, for instance in with a more flattened posterior side and rounded anterior side. In addition to the aforementioned dipping process, the flexible shell for the prosthetic implant may be formed using a molding process. For example, a rotational molding process such as described in Schuessler, U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,452, may be used. The process for forming texturing on the exterior surface is preferably done using a dipping technique, but the formation of the flexible shell may then be accomplished by one of a number of methods. An exemplary process for forming a textured outer surface on either a multi-layered shell as in FIG. 2 or a single-layered shell as in FIG. 3 will now be described. After the mandrel 20 of FIGS. 1A-1C is raised out of the dispersion with what is to be the final layer adhering thereto, this layer is allowed to stabilize. That is, it is held until the final coating no longer flows freely. This occurs as some of the solvent evaporates from the final coating, raising its viscosity. Again, it should be understood that alternative methods are contemplated for forming the flexible shell prior to the texturing process. The dip molding process advantageously results in the flexible shell pre-mounted on a dipping mandrel, which can then be used for the texturing process. However, if the flexible shell is made by another technique, such as by rotational molding, it can subsequently be mounted on a dipping mandrel and the process continued in the same manner. Once the flexible shell has been stabilized and mounted on the mandrel, any loose fibers or particles are blown off of the exterior of the shell with an anti-static air gun. A tack coat layer is then applied. The tack coat layer may be sprayed on, or may be applied by dipping the flexible shell on the mandrel into a tack coat material, for example, a tack coat dispersion. The operator immerses the flexible shell into the dispersion and returns the mandrel to a rack for stabilization. The time required for stabilization typically varies between about 5 and about 20 minutes. A suitable tack coat layer may be made using the same material employed in the base layers. After tack coat layer has been applied, rounded salt particles are applied substantially evenly over the entire surface. The solid particles may be applied manually by sprinkling them over the surface while the mandrel is manipulated, or a machine operating like a bead blaster or sand blaster could be used to deliver a steady stream of solid particles at an adequate velocity to the coating on the mandrel. In one embodiment, the coated mandrel is dipped into a body of the particles. In another embodiment, particle application is accomplished by exposing the coated mandrel to a liquid dispersion of the particles. It should be understood that the present invention is not intended to be restricted to any one particular method of applying the particles. In one embodiment, a salt bath for coating the tacky flexible shells is prepared by first procuring a quantity of rounded salt crystals and sorting the crystals into a desired size range. For example, unsorted rounded salt crystals are placed in a shaker having a first sieve size (e.g. coarse sieve) and a second sieve size (e.g. fine sieve). Larger salt crystals will be stopped by the coarse sieve at the inlet of the salt shaker, while smaller salt crystals will continue through both of the sieves. Crystals in the desired size range are trapped between the sieves. In a specific embodiment, the first sieve is a 14 mesh sieve and the second sieve is a 20 mesh sieve. In another embodiment, the first sieve is a 20 mesh sieve and the second sieve is a 40 mesh sieve. In yet another embodiment, the first sieve is a 40 mesh sieve and the second sieve is a 80 mesh sieve. In one embodiment, the rounded particles used in accordance with the invention have a substantially uniform particle size of between about 150 microns and about 1450 microns. In one embodiment, the rounded particles comprise or consist of relatively fine grained particles. For example, in one embodiment, the rounded particles have a maximum particle size of at least about 150 microns, for example, the particles have a maximum particle size in a range of between about 180 microns and about 425 microns. For example, about 90% of the rounded particles will be retained between a sieve having mesh size 80 and a sieve having mesh size 40. In another embodiment, the rounded particles comprise or consist of relatively medium grained particles. For example, in one embodiment, the rounded particles have a maximum particle size of at least about 300 microns, for example, the particles have a maximum particle size in a range of between about 425 microns and about 850 microns. For example, about 90% of the particles will be retained between a sieve having mesh size 40 and a sieve having mesh size 20. In yet another embodiment, the rounded particles comprise or consist of relatively large grained particles. For example, in one embodiment, the rounded particles have a maximum particle size of at least about 800 microns, for example, the particles have a maximum particle size in a range of between about 850 microns and about 1450 microns. For example, about 90% of the particles will be retained between a sieve having mesh size 20 and a sieve having mesh size 14. The size of the salt crystals can be selected by sorting a bulk quantity of rounded salt crystals using a series of gradually smaller meshes. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the salt crystals, for example, those having a particular size distribution are then added to an aqueous salt bath prior to being applied to the shell. The tacky flexible shells are immersed in the salt bath, rotated for even coverage, removed, and then allowed to stabilize. After a suitable period of stabilization, such as between about 5 minutes and about 20 minutes, the flexible shells may be dipped into an overcoat dispersion. A suitable overcoat dispersion may also be made using the same material employed in the base layers. The flexible shells on the mandrels are then mounted on a rack and allowed to volatilize for a sufficient time, such as, for example, about 15 minutes. In one embodiment, the entire silicone elastomer shell structure is vulcanized or cured in an oven at elevated temperatures. For example, the temperature of the oven is maintained at a temperature between about 200° F.'.\n",

No. 5,725,471; the U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/023,421, filed Aug. 15, 1996; the PCT International Application No. PCT/US97/14826, filed Aug. 15, 1997; the U.S. patent application Ser.

This application is also related to the U.S. non-provisional application Ser. No. 09/501,457 entitled Placebo Seat for Incontinence-Related Magnetic Stimulation Research filed Feb. 10, 2000, the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to an apparatus and a method for simulating the sounds and vibrations of a genuine magnetic nerve stimulator, in the preferred version, a transcranial magnetic stimulator (“TMS”), while reducing the induced current for the device from reaching the patient. The present invention relates to a sham TMS which presents the appearance, noise, apparatus, etc. of a genuine TMS, but which, in fact, may be used as a placebo in clinical studies to determine the therapeutic effectiveness of the genuine magnetic nerve stimulator or TMS. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION TMS is well known in the art. Magnetic stimulation realizes the electric fields necessary for the charge transfer by induction. Magnetic stimulation may be used to induce electric fields in biologic tissue. Rapidly changing magnetic fields induce electric fields in biologic tissue, and when the proper rates, intensity, depth of penetration are achieved, the magnetically induced electric field accomplishes transferring charge directly into the neuron to be excited. TMS involves the magnetic stimulation of neurons in the brain and has been used in the localization, characterization and treatment of brain function. TMS is known to non-invasively alter the function of the cerebral cortex. (See e.g. George M S, Wasserman E M, Post Rm, Transcranial magnetic stimulation: A neuropsychiatric tool for the 21 st century, J. Neuropsychiatry, 1996 8:373-382 , the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference). The magnetic fields used in transcranial magnetic stimulation are generally generated by large, rapidly-changing currents passing through a wire coil on the scalp. Use of a coil with a ferro magnetic core of a material with a saturability of at least 0.5 tesla has been found to be very effective. Two recent studies have suggested that rapid rate transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be used for exploring the functional neuroanatomy of emotions: emotionally healthy volunteers who received left pre-frontal stimulation reported an increase in self-rated sadness, while, in contrast, right pre-frontal stimulation to similarly healthy volunteers caused an increase in happiness. (See, Pascual-Leone A., Catala M D, Pascual A P, Lateralized effect of rapid rate transcranial magnetic stimulation of the prefrontal cortex on mood, Neurology, 1996; 46: 499-502; and, George M S, Wasserman E M, Williams W., et al., Changes in mood and hormone levels after rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation of the prefrontal cortex, J. Neuropsychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 172-180, the disclosures of which are also fully incorporated herein by reference.) Other reports have begun to delineate the therapeutic use of rTMS in depression. The earliest such studies used round, non-focal coils centered at the cranial vertex, with stimulation rates well under 1 Hertz (Hz). Results were promising but not always statistically significant. (See, Hoflich G., Kasper S. Hufnagel A. et al., Application of transcranial magnetic stimulation in treatment of drug-resistant major depression: a report of two cases, Human Psychopharmacology, 1993; 8: 361-365; Grisaru N., Yarovslavsky U., Abarbanel J., et al., Transcranial magnetic stimulation in depression and schizophrenia, Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 1994; 4: 287-288; and, Kilbinger H M, Hofilich G., Hufnagel A., et al., Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the treatment of major depression: A pilot study, Human Psychopharmacology, 1995; 10: 305-310, the disclosures of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.) Subsequently, George et al., described a striking improvement in some depressed patients from the treatment with rTMS over the left pre-frontal cortex. (See, George M S, Wasserman E M, Williams W A, et al., Daily repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves mood in depression, NeuroReport, 1995; 6: 1853-1856; and, George M S, Wasserman E M, Williams W E, Kimbrell T A, Little J T, Halleft M., Post R M, Daily left prefrontal rTMS improves mood in outpatient depression: a double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, Am. J. Psychiatry, 1997 (in press), the disclosures of which are fully incorporated herein by reference). A large study was reported by Pascual-Leone et al., who used a five-month double blind placebo-controlled cross-over design with five different treatment conditions. (See, Pascual-Leone A., Rubio B., Pallardo F. Catala M D, Rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in drug-resistant depression, The Lancet, 1996; 348: 233-237, the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference.) Left pre-frontal rTMS was uniquely effective in 11 of 17 young (less than 60 years of age) psychotically depressed and medication resistant patients. A recently developed TMS was disclosed by the present applicant and Charles M. Epstein in the PCT International Application NO. PCT/US97/14826, filed Aug. 15, 1997. That disclosure is therefore specifically incorporated herein by reference. The TMS studies have demonstrated a need for a sham TMS, which may be used as a placebo, to provide a control to determine the effectiveness of a device genuinely providing TMS. There is a need for a sham TMS which can be effectively used in placebo-controlled TMS blind studies. Accordingly, it is a goal of the present invention to provide a sham apparatus for transcranial magnetic stimulation, which may be used in placebo-controlled blind studies to further investigate the uses and effectiveness of TMS in the treatment of patients. Such a sham device must simulate, as much as practicable, the apparatus under investigation, while shielding the induced current of the device from reaching the patient, especially since the studies are related to ephemeral concepts, e.g., self-perception, depression, etc. concepts which are difficult to accurately measure. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for imitating the external appearance, sounds and vibration of a genuine TMS while keeping low the induced current which is actually transmitted to the patient. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a sham TMS which may be used as a placebo in studies to determine the effectiveness of a TMS apparatus and/or procedural protocol under investigation. A further object of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for realistically simulating a TMS, to be used as a control in legitimate and verifiable medical studies. As disclosed more fully hereafter, a method and an apparatus is described for realistically simulating a TMS wherein the induced current reaching the patient is kept to a very small percentage of the functioning core which is not provided with the sham shroud. The apparatus placebo comprises the genuine TMS device, modified however, such that an aluminum shroud is situated over the core&#39;s end faces. The aluminum plate absorbs a significant amount of the transmitted energy from the TMS, thus substantially keeping the induced current from penetrating to the patient who is receiving the TMS placebo treatment and/or device. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The apparatus of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing figures, in which: FIG. 1 is a side view of a core segment of a transcranial magnetic brain stimulator, shown without the aluminum shroud of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a front view of a core segment of the transcranial magnetic brain stimulator shown in FIG. 1, again without the aluminum shroud of the present invention. FIG. 3 is a front view of a transcranial magnetic brain stimulator, formed from four cores of the type shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, again without the aluminum shroud of the present invention, with a port between the middle core segments, a positioner in the locating port, and a coil schematically wrapped around the core segments, as positioned on a schematic human head; FIG. 4 is a side view of the transcranial magnetic brain stimulator shown in FIG. 3, without the aluminum shroud of the present invention, again shown placed on a schematic human head. FIG. 5 is a schematic side view of a TMS, equipped with a pair of {fraction (1/16)} inch thickness aluminum plates over the end faces of a core of the type shown in FIGS. 1-4, in conjunction with a saline tank, representative of a human head, to determine the effect of the sham, i.e., the manner that the plates effect the penetration/transmission of magnetic flux. FIG. 6 is a view similar to that of FIG. 5, showing a field plot of the base sham TMS of FIG. 5 showing field concentration at the edges of the plates. FIG. 7 is a view similar to that of FIGS. 5 and 6, with a {fraction (1/16)} inch aluminum arc-shaped sham spanning 90 mechanical degrees i.e., the aluminum plate extends from −45 to −135 degrees. FIG. 8 is a view similar to that of FIGS. 5 and 6, showing a 110 degree arc formed by a ⅛ inch aluminum plate as a sham. FIG. 9 is a chart of the Induced E field for no sham; the {fraction (1/16)}″ aluminum plate sham; {fraction (1/16)}″ continuous aluminum plate spanning 90° arc; and ⅛″ continuous aluminum plate sham, spanning a 110° arc within the saline tank, as a function of distance (in inches) along the arc. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The design of the invention is related to the design for a functioning or operational TMS as previously described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/345,572 filed Nov. 28, 1994 (the continuation of which is pending) and in PCT International Application No. PCT/US97/14826, filed Aug. 15, 1997, the disclosures of which are all fully incorporated herein by reference. Also incorporated by reference is U.S. Pat. No. 5,725,471, issued to Neotonus, Inc. which describes a preferred form of a magnetic nerve stimulator. Drawings relating to operational magnetic stimulators are provided in FIGS. 1 through 4. The specifications and details of the components of an operational stimulator are set forth in the PCT International Application No. PCT/US97/14826, filed Aug. 15, 1997 and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,725,471. In one operational magnetic nerve stimulator, the stimulator may induce electric fields similar in distribution to those from a Cadwell water-cooled figure-eight coil. As shown in FIG. 1, in an operational magnetic stimulator, a core ( 27 ) for the magnetic nerve stimulator is provided for stimulation of the brain. The stimulator core 27 is made of a magnetic material, preferably a ferromagnetic material. The stimulator core segment is basically hemispherical and terminates with two rectangular end faces ( 2 ), as shown in FIG. 4 Preferred materials for the core of an operational magnetic stimulator include vanadium permendur or 3% grain oriented steel. As shown in FIG. 1, an example of the core of an operational magnetic stimulator, core segment 27 is cut from an oval winding of 2 mil vanadium permendur. Two core segments can, in fact, be cut from a single oval winding, by cutting one core from each side of the oval. For illustration purposes, only a single core segment is shown in the diagram of FIG. 1. A method of construction of such a core is as described previously in the patent application, which is related to the present application, U.S. application Ser. No. 08/345,572, filed Nov. 28, 1994 and the continuation thereof. Cores may be constructed from thin laminate, highly saturable material (i.e. materials with a saturability of at least 1.5-2.0 Tesla, although less saturable materials with a saturability of 0.5 Tesla and higher can be used as well). A typical core can be made by winding two mil stock of vanadium permendur. A long ribbon of such material is wound on a mandrel (e.g. a mandrel of wood or plastic) for the radius, thickness and depth desired. Each side of the ribbon is coated with a thin insulative coating to electrically isolate it from its neighbor. After cutting the core segment 27 from the entire oval winding, a suitable core might span a preferred angle of approximately 208°, or in the range of about 205-215°. Other angles are possible, as well. Once the ribbon has been wound on the mandrel to the desired dimensions, it is dipped in epoxy to freeze its position. Once the epoxy has dried, the mandrel is removed and the core segments may be cut for the span of angle desired. The cut may destroy the electrical isolation of adjacent laminations. Each cut foil then must be finely ground so that it is smooth, and then a deep etch is performed. The deep etch is performed by dipping each of the cut ends in an acid bath. This causes the cut ends to slightly delaminate, but maintains the electrical isolation of the laminations. Failure to perform this deep etch seems to result in considerable eddy current loss and heating at the cut ends of the core segments. Following the deep etch, the ends are brushed with epoxy to maintain the shape and structural integrity of the core segment. The final step of the construction of an operational magnetic stimulator is to wind a coil of insulated wire about the one or more, side by side core segments. A typical inductance for a core of this type is about 20 μH. The operational magnetic stimulators however, may be practiced at other inductances or magnetic field strengths, if desired. As an alternative to cutting the core segment as a single section, the core can be first cut into a semi-circular section. In this method of manufacture, small triangular sections or wedges 34 at the bottom of the core are then cut separately, and attached to the semi-circular section as shown in FIG. 1. The smaller triangles may also be made from vanadium permendur. If necessary, however, the triangles can be any material or alloy that has a saturation of at least 0.5 Tesla. A suitable alloy for the triangular wedge sections, for example, is 2 mil 50% nickel alloy. As shown in FIG. 1, in one example of the core for an operational transcranial magnetic stimulator, core 27 has an outer diameter of approximately 4.75 inches. The core 27 has an inner semicircular aperture at the center of the core segment 27. Inner semicircle aperture has a diameter of approximately 0.75 inches. In the version where the smaller triangles are separate, triangular sections or wedges 34 are attached to the larger semi-circular section. Triangular sections 34 have a length on longer side (with respect to the shorter leg, not the hypotaenuse), in contact with semi-circular section 30 , of approximately 1.375 inches, and a length of approximately 0.75 inches on shorter side 42 which is approximately coplanar with the outside circumferential wall of the semi-circular section. As shown in FIG. 2, the cross sectional width of core segment 27 is approximately 0.625 inches and the wedges 34 are about the same thickness. As shown in FIG. 1, each of the core segments of the operational stimulator may be an open core, i.e. the core forms an open arc and does not constitute a closed toroid. An approximately C-shaped or horseshoe core is preferable. At least a portion of the core of the stimulator conforms, at least approximately, to the shape of the head. A hemispherical stimulator, having at least one, but preferably four adjacent, core segments (see FIG. 3) made of saturable or highly saturable ferromagnetic material may be used. The span of the core affects both the penetration depth of the magnetic field and the magnitude of the field. While a variety of angles are acceptable for the curvature of the arc of the core, a core of 208 degrees or approximately in the range of about 205-215 degrees (as shown in FIG. 1) is preferred and desired. Cores of approximately 190-230 degrees can be utilized. Alternatively, a core spanning an arc of approximately 180-270 degrees is also possible, although not necessarily believed as effective. To form an operational stimulator, four core segments may be positioned approximately flat side by flat side to form a complete magnetic stimulator. Although more than four core segments or less than four core segments are possible, four are preferred. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, two pairs of cores are placed side by side to form, by their open ends, a hemisphere-like opening designed for placement on a section of the head. The combined core segments are wound with a series of windings of wire to form a single functioning core component. Approximately nine to ten turns of wire may be used. In practice, it has been found that approximately nine (9) turns of wire should be wound around the larger stimulator formed of a single core segment of FIG. 1, and approximately ten (10) turns of wire should be wound around the stimulator formed of several core segments. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, approximately four-five (4-5) turns of wires are wound around each half of the stimulator, i.e., approximately four to five turns are wound around a first side or leg of the stimulator, and another four to five turns are wound around the second side or leg of the stimulator. The stimulator may be provided with a visualization and location port passing from outside circumferential wall to the inside for viewing and marking the head and locating and precisely relocating the stimulator thereon. A space is left open between the two pairs of cores to form a center port 62 (see FIG.'.\n",

As shown in FIG. 1, an example of the core of an operational magnetic stimulator, core segment 27 is cut from an oval winding of 2 mil vanadium permendur. Two core segments can, in fact, be cut from a single oval winding, by cutting one core from each side of the oval. For illustration purposes, only a single core segment is shown in the diagram of FIG. 1.

Other angles are possible, as well. Once the ribbon has been wound on the mandrel to the desired dimensions, it is dipped in epoxy to freeze its position. Once the epoxy has dried, the mandrel is removed and the core segments may be cut for the span of angle desired. The cut may destroy the electrical isolation of adjacent laminations. Each cut foil then must be finely ground so that it is smooth, and then a deep etch is performed. The deep etch is performed by dipping each of the cut ends in an acid bath. This causes the cut ends to slightly delaminate, but maintains the electrical isolation of the laminations. Failure to perform this deep etch seems to result in considerable eddy current loss and heating at the cut ends of the core segments. Following the deep etch, the ends are brushed with epoxy to maintain the shape and structural integrity of the core segment. The final step of the construction of an operational magnetic stimulator is to wind a coil of insulated wire about the one or more, side by side core segments. A typical inductance for a core of this type is about 20 μH. The operational magnetic stimulators however, may be practiced at other inductances or magnetic field strengths, if desired. As an alternative to cutting the core segment as a single section, the core can be first cut into a semi-circular section. In this method of manufacture, small triangular sections or wedges 34 at the bottom of the core are then cut separately, and attached to the semi-circular section as shown in FIG. 1. The smaller triangles may also be made from vanadium permendur. If necessary, however, the triangles can be any material or alloy that has a saturation of at least 0.5 Tesla. A suitable alloy for the triangular wedge sections, for example, is 2 mil 50% nickel alloy. As shown in FIG. 1, in one example of the core for an operational transcranial magnetic stimulator, core 27 has an outer diameter of approximately 4.75 inches. The core 27 has an inner semicircular aperture at the center of the core segment 27. Inner semicircle aperture has a diameter of approximately 0.75 inches. In the version where the smaller triangles are separate, triangular sections or wedges 34 are attached to the larger semi-circular section. Triangular sections 34 have a length on longer side (with respect to the shorter leg, not the hypotaenuse), in contact with semi-circular section 30 , of approximately 1.375 inches, and a length of approximately 0.75 inches on shorter side 42 which is approximately coplanar with the outside circumferential wall of the semi-circular section. As shown in FIG. 2, the cross sectional width of core segment 27 is approximately 0.625 inches and the wedges 34 are about the same thickness. As shown in FIG. 1, each of the core segments of the operational stimulator may be an open core, i.e. the core forms an open arc and does not constitute a closed toroid. An approximately C-shaped or horseshoe core is preferable. At least a portion of the core of the stimulator conforms, at least approximately, to the shape of the head. A hemispherical stimulator, having at least one, but preferably four adjacent, core segments (see FIG. 3) made of saturable or highly saturable ferromagnetic material may be used. The span of the core affects both the penetration depth of the magnetic field and the magnitude of the field. While a variety of angles are acceptable for the curvature of the arc of the core, a core of 208 degrees or approximately in the range of about 205-215 degrees (as shown in FIG. 1) is preferred and desired. Cores of approximately 190-230 degrees can be utilized. Alternatively, a core spanning an arc of approximately 180-270 degrees is also possible, although not necessarily believed as effective. To form an operational stimulator, four core segments may be positioned approximately flat side by flat side to form a complete magnetic stimulator. Although more than four core segments or less than four core segments are possible, four are preferred. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, two pairs of cores are placed side by side to form, by their open ends, a hemisphere-like opening designed for placement on a section of the head. The combined core segments are wound with a series of windings of wire to form a single functioning core component. Approximately nine to ten turns of wire may be used. In practice, it has been found that approximately nine (9) turns of wire should be wound around the larger stimulator formed of a single core segment of FIG. 1, and approximately ten (10) turns of wire should be wound around the stimulator formed of several core segments. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, approximately four-five (4-5) turns of wires are wound around each half of the stimulator, i.e., approximately four to five turns are wound around a first side or leg of the stimulator, and another four to five turns are wound around the second side or leg of the stimulator. The stimulator may be provided with a visualization and location port passing from outside circumferential wall to the inside for viewing and marking the head and locating and precisely relocating the stimulator thereon. A space is left open between the two pairs of cores to form a center port 62 (see FIG.'.\n",

FIELD OF INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to a method for dosing, creating or providing a substituate which was produced by a blood treatment apparatus. In addition, the present invention relates to a control device as well as a blood treatment apparatus for executing this method. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a medical functional apparatus, a digital storage medium, a computer program product, as well as a computer program related to the method. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION [0003] From practice, extracorporeal blood treatment apparatuses and methods are known in which a substituate is added to the extracorporeal blood circuit. Frequently, the substituate is produced online, i.e. during the blood treatment session and usually by the blood treatment apparatus itself. For this, a part of the dialysis liquid which is usually also produced online is prompted to also pass through the membrane of a second filter or a second filtration stage after it has passed through the membrane of a first filter or a first filtration stage. After running through this second filtration (sterile filtration), the substituate gained that way may be added to the contents of the extracorporeal blood circuit at a predilution site and/or a postdilution site of the extracorporeal blood circuit upstream and downstream, respectively, from the dialyzer or the blood filter. [0004] There are requirements with respect to the precision with which the substituate is added to the contents of the extracorporeal blood circuit. Thus, state-of-the-art apparatuses as known from practice comprise a high-precision dosing apparatus for dosing the substituate which is completely (e.g. in the form of a membrane pump in a blood cassette) or partially (e.g. in the form of a pump tubing segment for a roller pump at a conventional blood tube set or integrated in a blood cassette) part of the blood tube set which is used for the blood treatment. [0005] One object of the present invention is to propose a further method for dosing, creating or providing a substituate which was produced online. It is further an object of the present invention to propose a corresponding control device, a corresponding blood treatment apparatus, a corresponding medical functional apparatus, a digital storage medium, a computer program product as well as a computer program. [0006] All advantages achievable by the method according to the present invention may in certain exemplary embodiments according to the present invention undiminishedly be also achieved with the above-mentioned apparatuses and devices. [0007] Thus, according to the present invention, a method for dosing, creating or providing a substituate which was produced by a blood treatment apparatus is proposed. The method according to the present invention thereby takes place by a hydraulic system or a hydraulic section (hereafter in short: hydraulic system) of the blood treatment apparatus. The hydraulic system comprises at least one dialysis liquid supply line which leads into the dialysate chamber of a blood filter or a dialyzer (hereafter in short: dialyzer) or which supplies dialysis liquid to the dialyzer. The hydraulic system further comprises at least one substituate line as well as a first filtration stage and a second filtration stage. [0008] The dialysis liquid supply line supplies fresh dialysis liquid to the dialyzer, whereas the dialysate drain line which is mentioned further below discharges used or waste dialysis liquid, also denoted as dialysate, out of the dialyzer. [0009] The substituate line guides or conducts substituate being supplied to the interior or the contents of a blood circuit (substantially blood) used during the blood treatment for volume substitution, or it is provided herefor. [0010] Optionally, the hydraulic system may further comprise a branch line connecting the dialysis liquid supply line with the substituate line. Optionally, the connection is achieved via the filtration stage which is located between the branch line and the substituate line and which is hereafter denoted as second filtration stage. The branch line leads into the second filtration stage, it is connected with it and/or it conducts fresh dialysis liquid into it. The term “filter” which is herein also used instead of “filtration stage” can be understood as a synonym of filtration stage. A filtration stage may in turn comprise or consist of several filters. [0011] The method according to the present invention encompasses conveying a first fluid (or filtering the first fluid) through the first filtration stage which is upstream of the second filtration stage in flow direction and into the dialysis liquid supply line. Thereby, the fluid exits from the first filtration stage as a dialysis liquid which may be and/or is introduced in a dialyzer. [0012] The method according to the present invention further encompasses (actively or passively) conducting a share or part (of a flow share or a volume share) of the dialysis liquid into the substituate line which attaches to or follows after a second filtration stage or is downstream thereof in fluid communication with it, for example, in that the substituate line follows to the second filtration stage or is being fed from it. [0013] Upon passing through the second filtration stage, a substituate which can be and/or has been introduced into an extracorporeal blood circuit is being produced. [0014] The method according to the present invention further encompasses regulating or controlling the share of the dialysis liquid (or the size of this share) which exits from the first filtration stage and which in the second filtration stage is filtered or passes through its membrane, or the share which is guided into a medical functional apparatus via the substituate line after having been filtered at the second filtration stage or which is provided to be guided into the extracorporeally conducted blood of a patient. [0015] Regulating or controlling the share of the dialysis liquid or of the substituate which each are filtered in the second filtration stage or guided into the functional device (or into an extracorporeal blood circuit) takes place by affecting at least one conveying apparatus and/or at least one flow limitation device and/or a flow divider valve, which are each present in or affect the dialysis liquid supply line, the substituate line and/or the branch line. [0016] Affecting may take place by known measures to actuate flow limitation apparatuses or conveying devices. [0017] The control device according to the present invention, which may also be embodied as a regulating device, is provided, established, programmed and/or configured to control or regulate a blood treatment apparatus for or during execution of the method according to the present invention when interacting with the blood treatment apparatus. For this, it is during its use connected with the elements of the hydraulic system of the blood treatment apparatus which are to be controlled or regulated or it is in operative and/or signal connection with them. [0018] The blood treatment apparatus according to the present invention comprises a hydraulic system, which comprises at least one dialysis liquid supply line and at least one substituate line. The hydraulic system may optionally comprise at least one branch line as described above.

It comprises its own substituate line and a substituate port or connection. The substituate port is provided to receive substituate produced by the hydraulic system of the blood treatment apparatus from the substituate line of the hydraulic system. The medical functional apparatus does not comprise an apparatus which is arranged and/or provided for dosing the substituate which passes over from the substituate line of the functional apparatus into a blood-conducting line of the functional apparatus. [0020] The digital storage medium according to the present invention, in particular in the form of a disk, CD or DVD or EPROM, with electronically readable control signals may interact with a programmable computer system such that the mechanical steps of the method according to the present invention are prompted. [0021] The computer program product according to the present invention comprises a program code stored on a machine-readable storage device for prompting the mechanical steps of the method according to the present invention when the computer program product is executed or run on a computer.

      "Changed 'temperature' by 'method' in 'CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/950,420 filed on Jul. 18, 2007, entitled “CONTINUOUS TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT AND MAPPING FOR INTRA-CARDIAC MONITORING SYSTEM”, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD [0002] The technical field of the present application relates to continuous measurement and mapping of physiological data. BACKGROUND [0003] The temperature measurement of heart tissue can be essential for a patient&#39;s safety, especially during high energy stimulation and ablation procedures in a heart operation. Usually a single temperature sensor is used to measure the local heat status at the tip of a catheter during cardiac ablation. Furthermore, during other electrophysiological (such as high-current stimulation) and hemodynamic cases, there is no method available for continuous temperature measurement and mapping of the heart and circulation system which may result in an over heating risk of the myocardium tissue, even unnecessary burning and permanent tissue damage. [0004] Current cardiac hemodynamic and electrophysiological (EP) function monitoring utilize different kinds of approaches for patient signal/data conversion and acquisition, such as EP catheter for heart electrophysiological activity, pressure catheter for blood flow rate and cardiac output (CO) measurement, etc. However, there exist not enough methods and strategies for intra-cardiac tissue and blood temperature measurement and monitoring, except for single one tip-temperature monitoring during the ablation procedure. Cardiac temperature monitoring can provide more heart safety information as well as function estimation/evaluation, which can not be achieved using current hemodynamic and electrophysiological methods, such as the tissue safety during high-energy stimulation and acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) estimation/evaluation. SUMMARY [0005] In summary, there are several shortcomings and possible improvements with current hemodynamic and electrophysiological function monitoring strategies: For example, although the calculation relations between blood flow and blood pressure have been constructed, the function relations between cardiac tissue, temperature and blood flow have not been reliably and accurately determined and setup, which limit the medical application of temperature based analysis and monitoring, e.g. the tissue function and cardiac circulation evaluation during high energy stimulation and Pecutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) procedure. Current temperature monitoring is limited to single local point monitoring, such as the catheter tip-temperature monitoring in the ablation procedure, which may not provide enough temperature evaluation of the whole chamber or heart. Thus, there exists a need to spatially construct the temperature. Current cardiac hemodynamic and electrophysiological function monitoring cannot provide a temperature based cardiac function and tissue evaluation and prediction. Also, it is desirable to provide for continuous temperature based tissue and circulation monitoring and mapping which could provide a reliable approach for medical application evaluation, such as over-burning risk analysis for atrial fibrillation ablation, low temperature indication for AMI monitoring, estimation and predication of myocardial infarction. Continuous temperature analysis and EP monitoring have not been able to be combined and utilized together, which may limit the medical application since EP monitoring may not provide enough tissue function estimation and analysis. A close-loop function analysis/estimation and adaptive feedback control strategies have not been efficiently setup. For example, during high energy stimulation and ablation procedures, the frequency, power (current and voltage), speed, etc, have not been reliably controlled and optimized. Thus there exists a need for multi-position temperature monitoring and a temperature feedback close-loop control for such a procedure. According to various embodiments, a continuous multi-channel mapping strategy for function evaluation, cardiac tissue and circulation monitoring as well as safety information is proposed. [0006] According to an embodiment a system for continuous measurement and mapping of physiological data may comprise a catheter comprising a plurality of spaced apart sensors; a coupling unit for insulated coupling of the plurality of sensors with a measurement unit: and a mapping unit for mapping values received from the sensors to a predefined matrix. [0007] According to a further embodiment, the sensors may be temperature sensors. According to a further embodiment, the system may comprise a plurality of catheters each comprising a plurality of spaced apart sensors. According to a further embodiment, the catheter further may comprises a plurality of electrophysiological (EP) electrodes spaced apart from the temperature sensors. According to a further embodiment, temperature sensors and EP electrodes may be arranged alternately. According to a further embodiment, the temperature sensors may be thermistors and the coupling unit may comprise a first isolating transformer for transmitting a current to the plurality of temperature sensors. According to a further embodiment, the coupling unit may further comprise for each temperature sensor an associated voltage to frequency converter and at least one second isolating transformer coupled to the voltage frequency converter. According to a further embodiment, each voltage to frequency converter may have a predefined frequency range which is non-overlapping with another frequency converter and a single isolating transformer coupled with the voltage of frequency converters. According to a further embodiment, the temperature sensors can be thermistors. According to a further embodiment, temperature mapping unit can be operable to track a heart function, blood flow or any possible abnormal temperature locations. [0008] According to a further embodiment, the sensors may be pressure sensors. According to another embodiment, a catheter may comprise a plurality of sensors and electrodes, wherein the sensors are arranged alternately and spaced apart from each other. According to a further embodiment, the sensors can be temperature sensors such as thermistors or may be pressure sensors. According to a further embodiment, the catheter may further comprise a coupling unit for insulated coupling of the plurality of the thermistors with a measurement unit. According to a further embodiment, the coupling unit may comprise a first isolating transformer for transmitting a current to the thermistors. According to a further embodiment, the coupling unit may further comprise for each temperature sensor an associated voltage to frequency converter and at least one second isolating transformer coupled to the voltage frequency converter. According to a further embodiment, each voltage to frequency converter may have a predefined frequency range which is non-overlapping with another frequency converter and a single isolating transformer coupled with the voltage of frequency converters. [0009] According to another embodiment, a method for continuously measuring and mapping of physiological data, may comprise the steps of providing a catheter comprising a plurality of spaced apart sensors; providing a coupling unit for insulated coupling of the plurality of sensors with a measurement unit; and mapping values received from the sensors to a predefined matrix. [0010] According to a further embodiment, the sensors can be thermistors. According to a further embodiment, the method may further comprise the step of providing a plurality of catheters each comprising a plurality of spaced apart sensors and wherein each catheter further comprises a plurality of electrophysiological (EP) electrodes spaced apart from the temperature sensors. According to a further embodiment, the method may further comprise the step of transmitting power through a first isolating transformer for transmitting a current to the thermistors. According to a further embodiment, the method may further comprise the steps of measuring a voltage for each thermistor, convening the voltage into a signal having a frequency dependent on the voltage, transmitting the signal through a second isolating transformer, and converting the transmitted signal into a voltage. According to a further embodiment, the method may further comprise the step of tracking a heart function, blood flow or any possible abnormal temperature locations.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0018] To achieve better monitoring and diagnosis for the cardiac operation, according to various embodiments, a method for continuous temperature measurement and mapping is proposed which may include an isolated continuous cardiac temperature measuring method and/or a multi-channel temperature mapping and function scanning strategy for heart and circulation system. [0019] According to various embodiments, more efficient methods and strategies for cardiac function, tissue and circulation system monitoring, analysis, mapping, and evaluation as well as cardiac procedure application safety to the heart can be provided, which utilize continuous cardiac temperature monitoring, function scanning and mapping. Concurrently, the temperature monitoring and mapping technologies may also provide cardiac pathology estimation and prediction which other hemodynamic and EP monitoring can not perceive, such as temperature and its variability indicating over-burning, low blood flow (ischemic region) and abnormal cardiac activity along conducting pathway. [0020] Thus, the above mentioned shortcomings can be overcome and therefore the performance of the medical patient monitoring and analysis system will be improved. In summary, the following advantages over the conventional hemodynamic and electrophysiological techniques can be achieved: A continuous high-accurate temperature method and strategy for signal conversion and data transmission with high-voltage isolation and low noise interference. An easy and reliable calculation strategy for temperature and its variability with the tissue pathology, blood flow rate, and even cardiac output. A versatile multi-channel temperature monitoring strategy for cardiac tissue mapping and scanning, function evaluation, for both local region and chamber analysis, such as pathology analysis and prediction. A combined lead system for integration of both electrophysiological catheter and temperature lead system. The EP activity and temperature performance of the heart can be utilized together for more accurate cardiac diagnosis. An automatic feedback control strategy based on temperature monitoring and analysis which can more efficiently and accurately manipulate the current, voltage, frequency, etc, for stimulator and ablator, even disconnect the risky application. [0021] The following describes embodiments that pertain to the circuit design, development and strategies of a new catheter system of integrating multi-channel EP and temperature lead systems; a hardware system for supplying power, converting/transmitting temperature signal, providing an accurate and safe temperature measuring and monitoring system to the catheter in the cardiac operation; and a strategy of multi-channel temperature mapping and scanning for cardiac pathology analysis and prediction. [0022] FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of a catheter 110 usable for a patient 190 having a non-conductive support structure that carries a plurality spaced apart EP electrodes or leads 120 1 , 120 2... 120 n. In between the EP leads are arranged sensor leads 130 1 , 130 2... 130 n such as temperature sensors, pressure sensors or any other suitable sensor. According to an embodiment, thermistors can be preferably used as high precision temperature sensors as will be explained in more detail below. The EP leads are coupled to an EP lead coupling unit 140 for receiving signals suitable for stimulation or ablation provided by a high energy stimulator and/or ablator unit 170 whereas the sensor leads are coupled to a sensor measurement unit 150 such as a temperature measurement unit as will be explained in more detail below. To this end, the sensor unit 150 may be coupled with a safety analysis and adaptive feedback control unit 160 which can be coupled with the high energy stimulator and/or ablator unit 170. The high energy stimulator and/or ablator unit 170 sends output signals directly to the EP electrodes or via EP coupling unit 140. [0023] According to one embodiment, one or more such multi-channel catheters 110 can be used in a Multi-channel close-loop automatic control for high energy stimulator and ablator system as shown in FIG. 1. Via the close loop feedback controlling based on temperature calculation and monitoring, the operation procedure, such as stimulation and ablation (energy, current, voltage, frequency, pulse duration, etc) can be optimally adjusted. In FIG. 1 , according to one embodiment, the EP and temperature lead integration catheter 110 is employed to capture both cardiac electrophysiological activity and temperature (heat and energy) information, which can be used to construct a 2D or 3D EP function mapping as well as temperature mapping for pathology analysis and cardiac function image registration as will be explained in more detail below. [0024] Patient safety requires high voltage isolation between the subject 190 and the instrument 100. According to an embodiment as shown in FIG. 2 , a high voltage isolation transformer 240 is used to transmit the power to the isolated side (floating GND, patient ground) and supply the temperature measuring sensors. To this end, according to one embodiment a non-isolated power supply 210 is coupled with a sinusoidal wave oscillator 220 followed by a power amplifier 230 which feeds one side of transformer 240. Other circuits designs can be used to provide the appropriate power to the instrument side of transformer 240. The patient side of transformer 240 is coupled with a rectifier 250 which feeds a power filtering unit 260. The power filtering unit 260 is coupled with a current control unit 270 to control the current fed to a temperature thermistor 280. The temperature of the cardiac tissue and circulation can be captured by thermistor 280 and converted to frequency signals by a high accuracy voltage to frequency converter 245. The output of voltage to frequency converter 245 is coupled with the patient side of a second transformer 235. The instrument side of second transformer 235 is coupled with a frequency to voltage transformer 225 which outputs a voltage fed to an analog-to-digital converter unit 215. [0025] The voltage to frequency converter 245 can provide very accurate temperature measurement and this make it reliable to analyze and evaluate the temperature change and its variability. The temperature signal is converted and coded into a frequency by voltage to frequency converter (VFC) and then the frequency signal after transformer 235 is decoded back to a temperature signal by a frequency to voltage converter (FVC). According to an embodiment, the VFC and FVC are used as a pair for a continuous high precision temperature signal transmission. FIG. 2 illustrates a single continuous temperature measuring strategy and related hardware. The isolated temperature measurement and transmission provide not only safety but low noise and low artifacts distortion since VFC and FVC can greatly reduce the unwanted noise by controlling the signal frequency bandwidth. [0026] This measurement strategy is able to achieve continuous temperature monitoring with high accuracy which may provide a method for more stable and accurate measurement for any kind of minute changes of the myocardial tissue. For example, the local temperature drop or variation due to myocardial ischemia or infarction can be accurately and correctly captured by such an arrangement. Single local measurement can provide the temperature value as well as temperature variation with time, which may make it possible to predict the pathology of ROI (region of interest) of the heart that electrophysiological signal might not be able to catch and perceive, especially for high risky cardiac tissue point during high-energy stimulation and ablation. [0027] Based on such a single channel temperature measuring strategy and concept, according to another embodiment a multi-channel channel temperature measuring and monitoring 300 can be provided as shown in FIG. 3. The multi-channel temperature sensors can be from one temperature catheter or a combination of several temperature lead systems. Via the multi-lead temperature reconstruction, the temperature mapping and intra-cardiac heat flow scanning image can be achieved as will be explained below in more detail, which may provide a new method for cardiac pathology analysis and prediction, such as myocardial ischemia, etc. FIG. 3 shows the schematic of multi-channel temperature monitoring and analysis system. According to an embodiment, a central instrument power supply/management unit 320 provides the appropriate power via a first transformer 330 to a rectifier floating power supply unit 340. This unit 340 may supply a plurality of temperature sensors 130 1... 130 n. Each temperature sensor 280 1... 280 n sends its output signal to an associated voltage to frequency converter 370 1... 370 n which in turn transfers its output signal over an associated transformer 360 1... 360 n to an analog-to-digital signal converter (ADC) unit 350 1... 350 n. The respective digital signals from ADC units 350 1... 350 n are fed to a multi channel temperature monitoring and mapping unit 310. According to another embodiment, a single ADC unit and respective multiplexer arrangement can be used to convert the temperature signals. [0028] Temperature sensors, such as thermistors 280 1... 280 n can monitor different positions or tissue of the cardiac system, such as RV, RA or different points of the same chamber. Using multi-channel temperature sensors, a user is able to track the temperature of multi heart tissue points of interest, especially monitoring the blood flow pathway of different chambers and tissue function of the cardiac excitation pathway. According to another embodiment, as shown in FIG. 4 , multi-channel temperature signals can be transmitted by one isolated transformer 360 with different signal frequency bands. To this end, each voltage to frequency converter 370 1... 370 n may for example have a non-overlapping dedicated frequency range. On the instrument side an appropriate filter bank 380 may be provided to separate the signals from the various temperature sensors 280 1.'.\n",

      "Changed 'fig' by 'hair' in 'CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application claims the benefit of the filing date of provisional application 61/331,579, which was filed on May 5, 2010. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The invention is based on the feasibility of laparoscopic/endoscopic implantation (LION procedure—Laparoscopic Implantation Of Neuroprothesis) of multiple channel electrodes to the endopelvic portions of the sciatic and pudendal nerves (supralevator portions) by pelveo-abdominal approach (transperitoneally/retroperitoneally) for neuromodulation/stimulation of the pudendal and sciatic nerves together or separately in different combinations, or parts of the sciatic nerve (gluteal nerves, afferent and efferents sciatic fascicules) and/or of the pudendal nerve (afferent and efferent fascicules) in different combinations. The invention is indicated for treatment for neurogenic and non-neurogenic troubles or loss of function and pain in the lower extremities and/or pelvic and perineal organs and/or perineum. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Several techniques for stimulation of the pelvic nerves have been developed in the past. [0004] The sacral nerve root stimulation with sacral deafferentation, also called Brindley bladder controller, is based on the implantation of electrodes to the sacral nerve roots directly at their emergence from the spinal cord. This procedure requires a dorsal surgery with laminectomy, meaning exposure of the nerves at the back after opening the rachis. This procedure allows only en bloc stimulation of the sacral nerve roots, which means stimulation of the nerve fibers passing through the roots destined to the pelvic organs, the sphincter and the lower extremities all together and not separately. Therefore, stimulation induces at the same time bladder contraction, rectum contraction, erection and motion in the lower extremities. For control of bladder hyperactivity in spinal cord injured people, this technique required the cutting of the dorsal branches of the sacral nerves roots (sacral deafferentation) and post-stimulus effect for induction of a non-physiologic bladder voiding (bladder voiding occurs not during stimulation of the nerves but after interruption of the stimulation; early relaxation of the sphincters with further contraction of the bladder for a few seconds permits passing urine through the urethra). Therefore the stimulation must be repeated several times before the bladder is empty. [0005] Transforaminal sacral nerve stimulation (Tanagho—U.S. Pat. No. 4,607,639, FIG. 1), is a technique wherein a multiple channel electrode is introduced by blind percutaneous puncture from the back through the sacral foramen to the sacral nerve roots. Therefore, one electrode permits stimulation of only one sacral nerve root. That means that for the stimulation of the entire nerves destined to the lower limbs and the pelvic organs and sphincters, five electrodes would be necessary (there are five sacral nerves roots per side). That is not feasible since all actual pacemakers have one or at most two channels. In this technique, stimulation cannot permit selective stimulation of the nerve fibers destined to the lower limbs, to the pelvic organs and to the sphincter—similarly to the Brindley implantation. [0006] The perineal technique of implantation is a technique wherein an electrode is placed to the extrapelvic, that is, the perineal or infralevator portion of the pudendal nerve or its branches by perineal implantation at the space between the rectum and vagina in a female or testicles in males, the vagina or the rectum. In other words, this is an approach from below, between the legs. This technique of implantation permits selective stimulation of the pudendus nerve and its branches but permits a stimulation neither of the sciatic nerves, nor of the sacral nerves roots nor of the endopelvic portion of the pudenda nerve nor of any endopelvic nerves, because the perineum is separated from the pelvis (supralevator) by the pelvic floor. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0007] None of these previous techniques permit a selective implantation of electrodes to all endopelvic nerves. Only the approach of the nerves by passing through the abdomen and pelvis permits this. Only the laparoscopic pelveo-abdominal approach (transperitoneal or retroperitoneal) offer a visual access to all endopelvic nerves and plexuses and in the same time implantation of an electrode, and a morphologic and functional exploration de visu of the nerves. This is of importance because it can permit to exclude and eventually treat pathologies of the nerves such as fibrosis, endometriosis or a vascular entrapment before decision of implanting an electrode. [0008] The present invention therefore provides a method for altering operation of a nerve related to a given body condition, comprising the steps of: laparascopically gaining access to the endopelvic area of the abdomen through the abdominal wall; implanting a multiple channel electrode through the access on endopelvic portions of at least one nerve of the sciatic nerve, the pudendus nerve, or both; and operating the electrode to electrostimulate the at least one nerve. [0009] Implanting a multiple channel electrode on the pudendal nerve allows for treatment of body conditions selected from the group consisting of urinary and fecal incontinence; bladder, rectum and genital hyperactivity; bladder/rectum retention; erection disfunction; pain and combinations thereof. [0010] Implanting of a multiple channel electrode on the sciatic nerve allows for treatment of spasticity and spasms of the lower extremities, pain, osteoporosis, decubitus lesions, spinal cord injuries and combinations thereof. [0011] Implanting of the multiple channel electrode on both the sciatic and pudendus nerves allows for stimulation of combinations of both nerves which is particularly useful in spinal cord injury situations. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0012] A detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention follows, with reference to the attached drawings wherein: [0013] FIG. 1 illustrates the approach and implantation area in accordance with the present invention as well as the approach and implantation area of several known methods; [0014] FIG. 2 illustrates the location of the femoral nerve; [0015] FIG. 3 illustrates the location of the sciatic and pudendus nerves; [0016] FIG. 4 illustrates positioning of a multi-pole electrode in accordance with the present invention; [0017] FIG. 5 is a photograph illustrating the placement of a multi-pole electrode in accordance with the invention; [0018] FIG. 6 illustrates a further embodiment of the present invention utilizing a multi-pole electrode; [0019] FIG. 7 still further illustrates the embodiment of FIG. 6 ; [0020] FIG. 8 still further illustrates the embodiment of FIG. 6 ; and [0021] FIGS. 9 and 10 further illustrate placement of a multi-pole electrode in accordance with the present invention DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0022] The invention relates to a method for implanting a multiple channel electrode onto specific nerves and nerve roots in the endopelvic region, and thereby to address a number of issues as will be discussed below. [0023] FIG. 1 is an illustration of the human pelvis and shows approaches and implantation areas of various prior art methods as well as the method disclosed herein. [0024] Referring to FIG. 1 , from the upper left portion of the figure, the “Brindley” surgical approach or “dorsal spinal approach” is shown at arrow 1. Next on the left of the figure, a percutaneous tranforaminal approach such as is disclosed by Tanagho is shown at 2. The area in which implantation is made under the Tanagho approach is shown at 3. In the lower area of the figure, implantation area and perineal/vaginal approach are shown at reference 4 , and this corresponds to the teachings of Mann. [0025] The implantation area of the present invention is the endopelvic region, and this region is accessed in accordance with the present invention through laparoscopic entry via access through the abdominal wall. The region 5 which can be reached in this manner is shown in FIG. 1. In this region 5 , a collection of highly important nerves can be accessed together, and multiple channel electrodes can be implanted on these nerves to address a number of problems which have been long-standing issues in this art. [0026] The electrodes are placed to the endopelvic portions of the pelvic nerves. The exact location of such nerve is as is shown in FIG. 2 , showing the femoral nerve 10 , and FIG. 3 shows the location 20 of the sciatic and pudendus nerves. [0027] For the sciatic nerve, the endopelvic portion of the sciatic nerve is directly after fusion of the different sacral nerves roots and just before the sciatic nerve disappears through the greater sciatic foramen. At this point, a multiple channel electrode can be placed as shown in FIG. 3 , and this permits global pudendus and sciatic stimulation, but also selective stimulation of the sciatic nerve, of different portions of the sciatic nerves or of the pudendus nerve but also selective stimulation of the inferior and superior gluteal nerves. [0028] For the pudendus nerve, the endopelvic portion of the pudendus nerve (supralevator portion) is directly after it emerges out of the sacral plexus and just before it leave the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen. [0029] For the femoral nerve, the endopelvic retroperitoneal portion of the femoral nerve is lateral to the major psoas muscle before it leaves the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal. [0030] For the laparoscopic approach, a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach is used, while the introduction of the trocars is done through the abdominal wall (ideally at the navel) or in other places such as the pelvic wall. Further endoscopic ways can be used, such as LESS, NOTES, transgastric, transrectal, transvaginal, transvesical, and the like, but the laparascopic approach through the abdominal wall is preferred. [0031] For exposure of the endopelvic portion of the sciatic and pudendal nerves, three ways of dissection can be used, one through the lumbosacral fosse, the second through the obturatoric fosse and the third through the retropubic space (Retzius space). [0032] The functional integrity of the nerves is obtained by intraoperative electrical stimulation, a technique which is known to those skilled in the art. [0033] A multiple channel electrode is preferably implanted in direct contact to both the sciatic and the pudendal nerves in area 20 as shown in FIG. 3. The implantation can be done uni- or bilaterally (depending from the indication) while the cable(s) of the electrode(s) are tunneled retroperitoneally and connected to a permanent rechargeable generator implanted subcutaneously or endopelvically or endoabdominally or in direct connection to the electrode (“intelligent electrode”). [0034] The pudendus nerve is the nerve of the sphincters that control the contraction/relaxation of the anal and urethral sphincters but also genital organs. Selective pudendal stimulation (continuous or discontinuous) is obtained by application of a current on the part of the electrode 30 ( FIG. 4 ) that is in direct contact with the pudendal nerve (poles 1 , 2 and 3 in FIG. 4 ). [0035] Pudendal stimulation can be indicated in different pathological situations, including urinary and fecal incontinence, bladder, rectum and genital hyperactivity, bladder/rectum retention, trouble with erections, pain control and others, each of which is further described below. [0036] For urinary and fecal incontinence, stimulation of the pudendus nerve ( FIG. 4 ) induces contraction and therefore closure of the anal and urethral sphincters and can be indicated: [0037] in pathologies of the sphincters themselves (myogenic etiologies); [0038] secondary to surgeries (radical prostatectomy, hysterectomy, episiotomy, anal surgery, delivery, radiotherapy, local tumors, infectious diseases and abscess, fistula, malformations, prolaps; [0039] in pathologies of the innervation of the sphincters (neurogenic etiologies); and [0040] spina bifida, cauda equina, lesions of pelvic nerves secondary to surgery, radiotherapy, delivery, pelvic traumas, infections of the peripheric nervous system, pathologies of the central nervous system (Parkinson syndrome, dementia, infections, diseases, tumor, Strock). [0041] Bladder, rectum and genital hyperactivity can be addressed with stimulation of the pudendus nerve which can also induce an inhibition of detrusor and rectum contraction (See FIG. 5 ) and can be indicated in bladder over-activity (non-neurogenic)—neurogenic bladder hyperactivity (spina bifida, spinal cord injuries, para- and tetraplegics, multiple sclerosis, pathologies of the pelvic nerves (radiation, surgeries, delivery, tumor, endometriosis), pathologies of the central nervous system (dementia, Parkinson syndromes, Infections of nervous system, Strock)—secondary lesions of the spinal cord (spinal cord injuries, tumor, infection)—interstitial cystitis—mono- and polyneuropathies (autoimmune, endometriosis, diabetes)—neurogenic cystopathies (diabetes), and pathologies and lesions (secondary to surgery, vaginal delivery). FIG. 5 is a photographic image showing a multiple channel electrode implanted on the pudendus nerve (PN) and the sciatic nerve (SN). [0042] Bladder/rectum retention (detrusor Hypo- or atonia), Detrusor-Sphincter-Dyssynergy can be addressed with stimulation of the pudendus nerve as well. In bladder hypo- or atonia, the detrusor is not able to develop enough intravesical pressure to permit urine to pass the urethral sphincter. In Detrusor-Sphincter-Dyssynergy (DSD), the contraction of the urethra and the bladder is not coordinated so that when the bladder contracts, the sphincter, instead of relaxing, contracts too and blocks the passage of urine. In such situations, blockade of the sphincters in opened status permits passage of urine or stool ( FIG. 6 ). Such a pudendus nerve blockade can be obtained by three different kind of stimulation, namely high-frequency pudendus-nerve-conduction-blockade (Kilgore K L, Bhadra N. Nerve conduction block utilizing high-frequency alternating current. Med Biol Eng Comput 2004; 42: 394-406); anode blockade; and noise (H C. Tuckwell, J. Jost. Inhibition and modulation of rhythmic neuronal spiking by noise. Physical Review E, 2009, 80, 031907). [0043] Trouble with erection or erection disfunction can also be addressed. The pudendal nerve is involved in erection. Therefore, the LION procedure for recovery or improvement of erection can be indicated in myogenic, psychogenic, neurogenic and non-neurogenic indications. A further indication is functional troubles of the vaginal function in women (vaginismus, vaginal spasms). [0044] For pain control, because pudendal afferents fibers also transport sensitive and pain information to the central nervous system, pudendal stimulation can also be used for treatment for pain, such as pudendal pain, rectal/vaginal/perineal pain, cystodyny, prostadyny, pelvic pain syndrome, dyspareuny, and vulvodyny. [0045] The sciatic is the nerve destined to the buttock and the entire dorsal aspect of the lower extremities. It is the nerve for standing up and stabilization of the pelvis, but also for motion of the feet (flexion/extension). All sciatic fibers are only located together inside the pelvis, where electrodes are placed according to the invention. Selective sciatic stimulation (continuous or discontinuous) is obtained by application of current to the part of the electrode that is in direct contact with the sciatic nerve (poles 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 — FIG. 4 ). Because several poles are in direct contact to the sciatic nerve, stimulation can be applied to the entire nerve or to different parts (gluteal nerves) of the nerve. [0046] Therefore sciatic stimulation can be indicated in different pathological situations examples of which include spasticity and spasms of the lower extremities, decubitus lesions, pain control, spinal cord injuries and the like. [0047] Stimulation of the sciatic nerve permits control of spasticity and spasms in the lower limbs (eventually in combination with femoral nerve stimulation) because of neuromodulation of the afferent fibers contained in the sciatic nerve. In comparison to other kinds of blockade of the spasticity (sacral deaferrentiation, muscular botulinum injections, Baclofene pump) that all induce a muscle atrophy (myoatrophy), the blockade of spasticity using sciatic nerve neuromodulation induces a muscle training and therefore increase of muscle mass of the legs. This technique can be indicated in following conditions: spina bifida, spinal cord injuries, para- and tetraplegics, multiple sclerosis, pathologies central nervous system (dementia, Parkinson syndromes, infectious diseases of nervous system, Strock)—secondary lesions of the spinal cord (tumor, infectious diseases)—mono- and polyneuropathies (autoimmune, diabetes). [0048] Stimulation of the sciatic nerve permits control of all pain from the buttocks and lower extremities passing through the sciatic nerve itself. [0049] Stump and phantom pain secondary to amputation or other surgeries, poly- mono-neuropathy, Sudeck Morbus, secondary lesions and pathologies of the sciatic nerves and its branches (tumor, infection, surgical or traumatic lesions can also be addressed) [0050] In the present invention, a multiple channel electrode can be placed in direct contact to the sciatic and pudendal nerves together. Selective stimulation of one or the other is feasible as described previously, but in pathologies involving both nerves, stimulation of both nerves in different combinations can be helpful. For example, in patients affected by multiple sclerosis, stimulation of both nerves can permit at the same time control of pain (pudenda pain, leg pain), spasticity of the lower extremities, bladder hyperactivity, incontinence and retentions. In spinal cord injured patients and spina bifida, the LION (laparoscopic implantation of neuroprothesis) procedure to the pudendal and sciatic nerves together permit to control not only dysfunction but also to recover function as described below. [0051] Spinal cord injuries (para- and tetraplegics) are at an area of application for the invention. Bladder overactivity (BO) that occurs as a consequence of pathologies of the central or peripheral nerve system may cause incontinence, and when this occurs with detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia (DSD), high bladder pressures with vesico-ureteric reflux can also occur. Self-catheterization is a simple and efficient method of voiding the bladder, but maintaining low-pressure normally requires the use of medical treatment or botulinum therapy. A complete biological cure for spinal cord injury is, according to the literature, unlikely to be developed in the near future, and therefore electrical devices are still required to restore control of the lower urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. The Finetech-Brindley bladder controller is at present considered the only clinically available implantable system for bladder control, but is usually accompanied by a dorsal rhizotomy which is sufficient for a large number of paralyzed patients to reject the procedure since it is irreversible and may abolish sexual and defecation reflexes. Other electrical stimulation techniques currently under investigation also show promise but until now, no clinical device can be said to have solved the problem of bladder control as low-pressure physiological voiding cannot be reproduced yet and no device has successfully incorporated methods to produce both voiding and suppression of neurogenic detrusor overactivity in SCI people. [0052] Since laparoscopy permits implantation of electrodes to the sciatic nerves, the pudendal nerves and the sacral nerves roots, laparoscopic approach to the endopelvic nerves permit new strategies of electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerves to enhance pelvic organs and lower extremity functions. The LION procedure is the only method that enables recovery of pelvic functions and functions of the lower extremities in spinal cord injured people, and spina bifida.'.\n",

      "Changed 'balloon' by 'suitable' in 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] This invention relates generally to medical devices, and particularly to balloon catheters, including angioplasty and stent delivery balloon catheters. [0002] In percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, a guiding catheter is advanced until the distal tip of the guiding catheter is seated in the ostium of a desired coronary artery. A guidewire, positioned within an inner lumen of a dilatation catheter, is first advanced out the distal end of the guiding catheter into the patient&#39;s coronary artery until the distal end of the guidewire crosses a lesion to be dilated. Then the dilatation catheter having an inflatable balloon on the distal portion thereof is advanced into the patient&#39;s coronary anatomy, over the previously introduced guidewire, until the balloon of the dilatation catheter is properly positioned across the lesion. Once properly positioned, the dilatation balloon is inflated with liquid one or more times to a predetermined size at relatively high pressures (e.g. greater than 8 atmospheres) so that the stenosis is compressed against the arterial wall and the wall expanded to open up the passageway. Generally, the inflated diameter of the balloon is approximately the same diameter as the native diameter of the body lumen being dilated so as to complete the dilatation but not overexpand the artery wall. Substantial, uncontrolled expansion of the balloon against the vessel wall can cause trauma to the vessel wall. After the balloon is finally deflated, blood flow resumes through the dilated artery and the dilatation catheter can be removed therefrom. [0003] In such angioplasty procedures, there may be restenosis of the artery, i.e. reformation of the arterial blockage, which necessitates either another angioplasty procedure, or some other method of repairing or strengthening the dilated area. To reduce the restenosis rate and to strengthen the dilated area, physicians frequently implant an intravascular prosthesis, generally called a stent, inside the artery at the site of the lesion. Stents may also be used to repair vessels having an intimal flap or dissection or to generally strengthen a weakened section of a vessel. Stents are usually delivered to a desired location within a coronary artery in a contracted condition on a balloon of a catheter which is similar in many respects to a balloon angioplasty catheter, and expanded to a larger diameter by expansion of the balloon. The balloon is deflated to remove the catheter and the stent left in place within the artery at the site of the dilated lesion. [0004] In the design of catheter balloons, balloon characteristics such as strength, flexibility and compliance must be tailored to provide optimal performance for a particular application. Angioplasty balloons preferably have high strength and a high rupture pressure for inflation at relatively high pressure, and high flexibility and softness for improved ability of the catheter to track the tortuous anatomy and cross lesions. The balloon compliance is chosen so that the balloon will have a desired amount of expansion during inflation. Compliant balloons exhibit substantial stretching upon application of internal pressure, whereas noncompliant balloons exhibit relatively little stretching during inflation. [0005] In the manufacture of catheter balloons, a variety of methods have been used to sterilize the catheter before use including exposure to an electron beam (i.e., e-beam) or a sterilizing fluid such as ethylene oxide (i.e., EtO). One difficulty has been sterilizing polymeric materials which degrade substantially in response to a conventional sterilization method. Degradation of the polymeric material will reduce the rupture pressure of the catheter balloon. Increasing the wall thickness of such balloons to provide an acceptably high rupture pressure increases the profile and stiffness of the balloon, and consequently decreases the trackability and crossability of the catheter in the patient&#39;s vasculature. Thus, what has been needed is an improved method of sterilizing medical devices. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] This invention is directed to a method of sterilizing a medical device component, such as a catheter balloon or shaft, in which an electron beam (i.e., e-beam) is applied to the component in an evacuated or inert gas-filled container. The method of the invention allows for electron beam sterilization without significant degradation of the component polymeric material. It is believed that by minimizing the presence of air during the electron beam sterilization, the method inhibits or prevents the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen radicals which would otherwise form from the action of the electron beam radiation on air. Another aspect of the invention is a medical device component, e-beam sterilized according to a method of the invention. A variety of medical device components can be sterilized by the method of the invention, and particularly intracorporeal devices for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, such as balloon catheters, catheter shafts and balloons, stent covers, and vascular grafts. In one embodiment, the device component is configured to be pressurized or expanded during use, and the method of the invention provides such a device component with a rupture pressure that is not significantly decreased due to electron beam sterilization. Although discussed primarily in terms of a balloon for a balloon catheter, the invention should be understood to include other medical devices. The terminology “medical device component” should be understood to include an independent, complete item such as a vascular graft or balloon catheter, or alternatively, a part of a larger device such as a balloon or a shaft of a balloon catheter. [0007] In one embodiment, the balloon itself, which has typically already been secured to a catheter shaft to form an assembled balloon catheter, is evacuated and/or filled with an inert gas before the electron beam sterilization. In a presently preferred embodiment, the balloon is purged by applying a vacuum to evacuate the balloon and back filling the evacuated balloon with an inert gas. Thus, the air which would have been present inside the balloon and catheter shaft interior is removed and replaced with an inert gas before the electron beam sterilization. As a result, the degradation of the balloon polymeric material due to the electron beam sterilization is minimized. In a presently preferred embodiment, the balloon catheter is purged before being placed inside the container, and before the container is similarly purged by evacuating the container and back filling the container with an inert gas. However, in an alternative embodiment, the balloon catheter is purged after being placed in the container. [0008] The inert gas used for purging in the method of the invention is a gas which when exposed to an electron beam does not form radicals causing oxidative degradation, i.e., hydrogen abstracting radicals. Preferred inert gases are noble gases, and most preferably argon. The heaviness of argon makes it more preferable than helium. However, gases other than the noble gases could be used as the inert gas, provided the gases lack oxygen. Thus, for example, nitrogen could be used as a low cost alternative to argon as the purging gas, because nitrogen is less susceptible than oxygen to the formation of reactive radicals causing oxidative degradation, upon exposure to an electron beam. Thus, the air tight, oxygen- or air-free container sealed with the balloon catheter therein provides an environment for the catheter during electron beam sterilization which does not form reactive radicals which cause significant oxidative degradation of the balloon catheter upon exposure to the electron beam during the sterilization. [0009] In a presently preferred embodiment, the container is filled with inert gas so that the container has a positive pressure which thus prevents or inhibits air leaking into the container in the event that pinholes develop in the container. The inert gas consequently prevents degradation of the balloon polymer during or shortly after the electron beam application and the attendant loss of sterilization if pin holes develop in the container during storage of the catheter. However, in an alternative embodiment, the container is merely evacuated by applying a vacuum to the container and sealing the container, without necessarily filling the container with an inert gas before and the container sealed with the medical device component therein. The container and balloon are evacuated by applying a vacuum to an interior thereof to thereby reduce the internal pressure therein to less than the ambient pressure. For example, the absolute pressure in the evacuated container is typically not greater than about 50 mTorr. After filling with the inert gas, the pressure inside the inert gas-filled container is typically not less than about 1 atm (760 Torr). In a presently preferred embodiment, the container (with the balloon catheter therein) is purged inside a vacuum chamber. Thereafter, the container may be sealed inside the evacuated or inert gas-filled vacuum chamber if the vacuum chamber contains a sealer, or transferred to another vacuum chamber containing a sealer. Alternatively, the purged container may be removed from the vacuum chamber and maintained in an open end-up orientation and sealed outside the vacuum chamber. Inert gas such as argon is heavier than air and will thus prevent air going into the argon-filled container when the container is held with the open end of the container up in an air-filled environment prior to sealing the container. [0010] A catheter polymeric balloon sterilized according to the method of the invention has minimal degradation of the polymer, and consequently, a minimal decrease in rupture pressure due to the sterilization. After the electron beam sterilization according to the method of the invention, the balloon has a mean rupture pressure which is not significantly less than (i.e., not more than 5% to about 25% less than, and preferably not more than about 10% to about 15% less than) the rupture pressure of the balloon before the electron beam sterilization of the method of the invention. Furthermore, the balloon preferably has a high fatigue resistance, i.e., cycles to failure, which is not significantly less than (i.e., not more than about 5% to about 10% less than) the fatigue resistance of the balloon before the electron beam sterilization of the method of the invention. After accelerated aging to simulate shelf life of the balloon in which the balloon is aged at about 45° C. to about 65° C. for about 1 to about 3 weeks, a balloon sterilized according to the method of the invention in an evacuated or inert gas-filled container has a mean rupture pressure which is significantly higher than (i.e., more than about 15% to about 25% higher than) the rupture pressure of a balloon electron beam sterilized in the presence of air although otherwise similarly aged and sterilized, and a fatigue resistance which is significantly higher than (i.e., more than about 1000% to about 1500% higher than) the fatigue resistance of the balloon electron beam sterilized in the presence of air. [0011] The medical device component sterilized according to the method of the invention can be formed of a variety of suitable polymeric materials, and in one embodiment is formed of a polymeric material selected from the group consisting of polyamides and fluoropolymers. In a presently preferred embodiment, the balloon is formed of a polyamide polymeric material such as polyether block amides (PEBAX), available from Atochem. The PEBAX material would typically degrade as a result of an electron beam sterilization in the presence of air. Therefore, in one embodiment, the method of the invention provides an electron beam sterilized PEBAX balloon with a sufficiently high rupture pressure and fatigue resistance, and without requiring an increase in the balloon wall thickness to maintain the rupture pressure and fatigue resistance of the balloon. A catheter balloon of the invention typically has a wall thickness of about 0.0005 to about 0.001 inches (about 0.013 to about 0.03 mm) for a 3.0 mm nominal outer diameter balloon, and a wall thickness of about 0.0008 to about 0.0015 inches (about 0.02 to about 0.04 mm) for a 5.0 mm nominal outer diameter balloon. Similarly, other medical device components sterilized by the method of the invention may be formed of PEBAX or fluoropolymers. For example, in one embodiment, a fluoropolymer such as polytetrafluoroethylene (TEFLON) or polyvinylidiene fluoride (PVDF) forms the catheter shaft, or a layer such as an inner lubricious liner of the catheter shaft, and the method of the invention provides for electron beam sterilization of the shaft without significant degradation of the fluoropolymer. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) fluoropolymer will degrade to a lesser degree when electron beam sterilized in the absence of air/oxygen according to the method of the invention, than when electron beam sterilized in the presence of air. [0012] A balloon catheter sterilized according to a method of the invention generally comprises an elongated shaft having a proximal end, a distal end, and an inflation lumen therein, with the balloon secured to a distal shaft section and having an interior in fluid communication with the inflation lumen. The balloon catheter can be used for a variety of applications including PTCA, peripheral angioplasty, stent delivery, arid the like. [0013] The sterilization method of the invention avoids significant degradation of the polymeric material of the medical device component, as a result of sterilizing the medical device component in an evacuated or inert gas-filled container. Consequently, the method provides a sterilized medical device component such as a catheter balloon having a sufficiently high rupture pressure, without requiring an increase in the wall thickness of the balloon. The method thus provides for improved manufacturability of the balloon catheter, and a balloon catheter having excellent performance characteristics such as low profile and flexibility, for excellent trackability, and a desired rupture pressure and fatigue resistance. These and other advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description and accompanying exemplary drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0014] FIG. 1 is an elevational view, partially in section, of a balloon catheter for delivering a stent, having a balloon sterilized according to a method that embodies features of the invention. [0015] FIG. 2 is a transverse cross-section of the catheter shown in FIG. 1 , taken at line 2 - 2. [0016] FIG. 3 is a transverse cross-section of the catheter shown in FIG. 1 , taken at line 3 - 3. [0017] FIG. 4 illustrates a balloon catheter in a container during electron beam sterilization according to a method which embodies features of the invention. [0018] FIG. 5 illustrates a stent cover or vascular graft sterilized according to a method that embodies features of the invention. [0019] FIG. 6 is a transverse cross-section of the stent cover or vascular graft shown in FIG. 5 , taken at line 6 - 6. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0020] FIG. 1 illustrates an over-the-wire type stent delivery balloon catheter 10 embodying features of the invention. Catheter 10 generally comprises an elongated catheter shaft 11 having a proximal end 12 , a distal end 13 , and an inflatable balloon 14 on a distal shaft section. An expandable stent 16 is mounted on balloon 14 for implanting in the patient&#39;s body lumen 18. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1 , the shaft 11 comprises an outer tubular member 19 and an inner tubular member 20. As best shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 , illustrating transverse cross sections of the catheter 10 shown in FIG. 1 , taken along lines 2 - 2 and 3 - 3 , respectively, outer tubular member 19 defines an inflation lumen 21 , and inner tubular member 20 disposed within the outer tubular member lumen 21 defines a guidewire lumen 22 configured to slidingly receive a guidewire 23. Inflatable balloon 14 is disposed on a distal section of catheter shaft 12 , having a proximal end sealingly secured to the distal end of outer tubular member 19 and a distal end sealingly secured to the distal end of inner tubular member 20 , so that its interior is in fluid communication with inflation lumen 21. An adapter 24 at the proximal end of catheter shaft 11 is configured to provide access to guidewire lumen 22 and to direct inflation fluid through arm 26 into inflation lumen 21. The distal end of catheter may be advanced to a desired region of a patient&#39;s body lumen 18 in a conventional manner and balloon 14 inflated to expand stent 16. The catheter 10 is withdrawn after deflating the balloon 14 , leaving the implanted stent 16 in the body lumen 18. [0021] Balloon 14 is sterilized by applying an electron beam to the balloon 14 according to a method of the invention. FIG. 4 illustrates a schematic view of an apparatus 30 useful in a method which embodies features of the invention, with catheter 10 inside the apparatus 30. The catheter 10 is inside an open, sealable container 32 which is inside a vacuum chamber 34. Vacuum source 36 and inert gas source 37 are connected to the chamber 34 , for evacuating chamber 34 and open container 32 therein and filling with an inert gas, respectively. In a presently preferred embodiment, the assembled catheter 10 with balloon 14 on catheter shaft 11 is purged before it is placed inside the chamber 34 or inside the container 32 , by applying a vacuum to the inside of the catheter 10 and then filling the evacuated catheter 10 with inert gas. Specifically, the catheter is evacuated by reducing the absolute internal pressure therein to about 20 to about 250 mTorr, preferably about 20 to about 100 mTorr. The evacuated balloon is then filled with inert gas until the pressure inside the catheter is about 1 atm (760 Torr). [0022] The purged catheter 10 is then placed inside the container 32 inside the chamber 34. Before the catheter 10 is placed inside the container 32 , the balloon 14 is typically folded and pressed on the catheter shaft 11 under vacuum or inert gas, and if intended for use as a stent delivery catheter, the stent mounted on the balloon. The chamber 34 is then purged by evacuating and filling with an inert gas, which also purges the open container 32 therein. Specifically, the container 32 and chamber 34 are evacuated by reducing the pressure to a pressure of about 20 to about 250 mTorr, preferably about 20 to about 100 mTorr using vacuum source 36 , and then filled with inert gas using inert gas source 37 to an absolute internal pressure of about 1 atm (760 Torr).'.\n",

      "Changed 'cells' by 'pump' in '[0001] The present invention relates to a product obtained from gastropod spawn, to be used in the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions capable of activating and mobilising skin stem cells, as well as preventing the loss thereof that takes place as a consequence of chronological and/or premature ageing of the skin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] The skin is the largest organ in the human, or animal, body. It acts as a protective barrier that isolates the body from the surrounding medium, protecting it and contributing to preserve its structures intact, whilst acting as a communication system with the environment. The skin has three layers: the epidermis, which is the most superficial layer, the dermis, which is the intermediate layer, and the hypodermis or subcutaneous tissue, which is the deepest layer of the skin. [0003] Since it is the outermost organ, the skin is subjected to significant deterioration and aggression, which leads to premature ageing of the skin. The external factors that act thereon include excess solar radiation, atmospheric contamination, abusive use of surfactants, tobacco smoke, etc. But the skin may also suffer from premature ageing as a result of internal or endogenous factors, such as those related to an unbalanced nutrition in terms of vitamins, iatrogenic factors such as radiotherapy, the intake of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, etc., or the presence in the body of very reactive toxins such as those ingested by drug addicts, alcoholics, etc. Natural ageing also occurs as a consequence, for example, of the production of free radicals in the mitochondria, DNA alterations, etc. [0004] Deterioration of the skin appears in the form of wrinkles, spots, laxity, benign neoplasms, etc. [0005] Numerous cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions have been disclosed for treatment of the skin, and the care and cleaning thereof, composed of very different ingredients, which include plant extracts and animal extracts. In this regard, one of the ingredients used in the preparation of skin care cosmetics have been gastropod secretions, what is commonly referred to as snail slime. Thus, for example, document DE1813154 discloses a composition designed for skin care that contains a fat and one or more active agents, which contains the slippery lubricating secretion excreted by a snail, particularly Helix pomatia. Patent FR2595247 discloses that extracts from the mucous membranes or digestive juices of gastropods are useful in cosmetics at concentrations ranging between 0.1%-10% due to their moisturising action on the epidermal surface. U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,740 discloses an active ingredient for cosmetic or therapeutic compositions obtained from the secretion of a centrifuged live gastropod, and said compositions may be applied to skin care. [0006] On the other hand, document CA2611645 discloses the use of a Helix aspersa “snail slime” product to stimulate the proliferation of stem cells in vitro. [0007] A stem cell is a cell that has the capacity to renew itself by means of mitotic divisions or to continue the differentiation pathway for which it is programmed. Moreover, it is capable of producing cells of one or more mature, functional, fully differentiated tissues, as a function of its degree of multipotentiality. Most of the tissues of an adult individual have their own specific population of stem cells which allow for their periodical renewal or their regeneration when tissue damage occurs. In particular, the epidermis undergoes constant renewal and consists of a stratified squamous epithelium associated with pilose follicles and sebaceous glands. These specialised structures are maintained by the self-renewal of epidermal stem cells and the differentiation of the offspring thereof. Skin stem cells are crucial for the healing of wounds and the regeneration of the skin and the hair. However, the capacity of stem cells may be diminished due to genetic problems, environmental influences and the ageing process. Therefore, the protection of stem cells is extremely important. [0008] Although snail secretions are known to be useful for the preparation of skin cosmetics, thus far no product derived from snail spawn has been disclosed for the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions that has a proven action on skin stem cells, activating and mobilising them, thereby preventing the loss thereof and, consequently, preventing and correcting ageing of the skin. [0009] In this regard, the present invention discloses a product obtained from gastropod spawn for the preparation of cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions which has been shown to have very beneficial effects on the skin, preventing and correcting the ageing thereof by acting directly on epithelial stem cells. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0010] The object of the present invention consists of a product prepared from gastropod spawn of the family Helicidae, which is used for the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions for the skin. Said product has the capacity to act on stem cells, activating and mobilising them, thereby preventing the loss thereof as a consequence of ageing of the skin caused by both endogenous and exogenous stressful factors. [0011] The product is composed of organic and inorganic molecules from snail spawn, the organic molecules being polysaccharides, proteins, glycoproteins, peptides and amino acids, where the proteins and glycoproteins present a characteristic electrophoretic pattern, similar to that shown in FIG. 1 , and the inorganic molecules being cations and anions such as phosphate, calcium, sodium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper and selenium, in their most stable ion forms. [0012] The product derived from snail spawn is used in the preparation of dermo-cosmetic compositions in the form of serum, solutions, injectables (monodose), gel (Hydragel), o/w gel-cream, w/o gel-cream, o/w cream, w/o cream, w/s cream, o/w/o cream, extemporaneous facial mask preparations, patches and, in general, all dermo-cosmetic (cosmeceutical) forms that may be used in the formulation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical products. Said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, facilitates the rescue of skin stem cells intended to disappear due to senescence or endogenous or exogenous aggressions, and promotes the activation of said cells, as shown in Example 2 of the present specification. This activation is characterised by premature induction of DNA replication during cell division. [0013] Moreover, said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, promotes the mobilisation of skin stem cells, which translates into the passage thereof from the basal area of pilose follicles to the interfollicular epithelium and distribution therein. The pilose follicle is the part of the skin where stem cells concentrate. [0014] The spawn wherefrom the product of the present invention is prepared were obtained from gastropods grown in greenhouses protected from excess light, direct rain and aggressions by animals and insects. The climate and the protection offered by the greenhouse made it possible for the snails to be under optimal temperature and humidity conditions. The gastropods were fed with fodder, water and green plants, radishes and vegetables, and performed their natural hibernation and reproduction cycles. [0015] The gastropods of the family Helicidae used for the preparation of the product in question are selected from the group that comprises Helix aspersa, Helix pomatia, Helix lucarum, Helix lutescens, Helix hortensis, Helix aperta, Helix pisana, Otala punctata, Iberus gualtieranus alonensis, Helix nemoralis, Helix fructicola, Helix strigella, Helix fruticum, Helix bidens, Helix arbostorum, Helix rotundata, Helix aculeata, Helix pulchella, Helix personata, Helix holoserica, Helix alonensis and Helix candidissima. [0016] The process of obtaining the product derived from snail spawn of the present invention is described below. During their reproductive period, snails deposit their spawn in terracotta flower-pot receptacles containing soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 18° C.-24° C. and 60%-100% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0017] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2° C. and 8° C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration ranging between 40% and 70% (w/w), in purified water, or saline solution, or a component or combination of components of the definitive dermo-cosmetic formulation; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a grinder, colloidal mill or in-line homogeniser; filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh, and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of the suitable dermo-cosmetic preparations. [0018] The final concentration of the product derived from snail spawn in the definitive dermo-cosmetic composition may range between 0.1% and 70% (w/w).

EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of the Product and of a Topical Composition that Contains it as an Active Ingredient [0022] During reproduction, snails deposit their spawn in flowerpots that contain soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 21° C. and approximately 80% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0023] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2° C. and 8° C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration of 70% (w/w), in purified water; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a Silverson mill; they are filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of a cream, using it at a 70% concentration. Example 2 Evaluation of the Activity of the Product Derived from Snail Spawn on the Dynamics of Skin Stem Cells [0024] Since stem cells in the adult epidermis divide infrequently, they are identified with cells that retain a specific DNA label (DNA label-retaining cells, LRCs). The cells that are undergoing division in an animal model (mouse) may be labelled by means of repeated pulses of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or titriated 3 H-thymidine. The label will be progressively lost following the successive divisions; however, keratinocytes that divide very infrequently (slow-cycling keratinocytes) retain the label for long periods of time (LRCs) (Bickenbach J R, McCutecheon J, Mackenzie I C. Rate of loss of tritiated thymidine label in basal cells in mouse epithelial tissues. Cell Tissue Kinet. 19(3): 325-333, 1986; Cotsarelis G, Sun T T, Lavker R M. Label-retaining cells reside in the bulge area of pilosebaceous unit: implications for follicular stem cells, hair cycle, and skin carcinogenesis. Cell. 61(7): 1329-1337, 1990). LRCs are preferably located in the bulge area, or prominent region, of the pilose follicles of the murine epidermis (Fuchs E, Tumbar T, Guasch G. Socializing with the neighbors: stem cells and their niche. Cell. 116(6): 769-778, 2004). The stem cells in the bulge are bipotential, since they may lead to both follicle keratinocytes and a cell population with a high division capacity, called transit-amplifying cells (TA). TAs migrate to the interfollicular epidermis and progressively show a lower differentiation potential; finally, they divide, leading to terminal differentiation keratinocytes. Occasionally, TAs have been considered to be stem cells, since they have a high proliferative potential. However, many authors indicate that only the cells in the bulge should be called stem cells, whereas those in the interfollicular epidermis would be the TAs. [0025] The efficacy of the product derived from snail spawn, obtained as indicated in Example 1, was evaluated by applying it onto the skin of newborn C57BL/6 mice in the form of a cosmetic composition (cream). [0026] The effect of the product in question on the proliferation and migration of epidermal stem cells was analysed; to this end, 30 newborn C57BL/6 mice were used, distributed in three groups, establishing a minimum of 5 animals per group: Group C: Control (untreated animals). Group M1: Animals treated with Sample 1 (cosmetic composition that contains the product derived from the snail spawn). Group M2: Animals treated with Sample 2 (cosmetic composition with the same vehicle as Sample 1 which does not contain the product derived from the snail spawn). [0030] The experiments were performed in accordance with the standards regulating the manipulation and protection of laboratory animals (Royal Decree 1201/2005). [0031] The method used in this study to identify and quantify epidermal stem cells is based on the low proliferation frequency of this cell type with respect to the remaining cell populations in the tissue (Braun K M, Niemann C, Jensen U B, Sundberg J P, Silva-Vargas V, Watt F M. Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130(21): 5241-5255, 2003). [0032] The cells undergoing division may be labelled by means of injections of tritiated thymidine ([ 3 H]thymidine) or 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU), which are thymidine analogues, such that the labelled nucleotides are incorporated into the DNA replication process. After a short period of time (about 24 h) from the administration of a single dose of the analogue to an adult animal, the label is detected in the cells with the highest proliferation rate ( FIG. 2 a ). The cells with the highest division rate are identified in the stratum basale of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), sebaceous gland (SG), infundibulum (Inf) and, especially, the pilose bulb (BP), whereas the quiescent cells of the prominent region or “bulge” (PR) remain unlabelled ( FIG. 2 a ). If the labelling injections are serial and sufficiently numerous, those cells with a low proliferation rate (potential adult stem cells) may also incorporate the label into the chromatin by means of processes other than replication, involved in the repair and maintenance of the DNA double strand ( FIG. 2 b ). Several months after the last of the serial injections, the label is diluted in most cells as a result of the successive DNA replication cycles, whereas those cells with a minimal proliferation rate remain labelled for at least 10 weeks; for this reason, they are called label-retaining cells (LRCs). In the adult epidermis at rest, which primarily contains pilose follicles in the telogen or resting phase, the primary location of LRCs is the so-called prominent region (“bulge”) of the pilose follicle ( FIG. 2 c ). [0033] Once a day, for four consecutive days, the 10-day-old mice received an injection of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (6.25 mg/ml, 50 mg/kg of body weight) in PBS phosphate buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 ), in order to label those cells that were in the DNA replication phase. Approximately 50 days after the labelling with BrdU, Samples 1 and 2, in their cream form, were topically applied twice a day, for 11 consecutive days, on the skin of the tails of the mice. Subsequently, these animals and their corresponding controls were sacrificed in a CO 2 chamber, in two different series for each group (five mice per group and series): immediately following the treatment, or ten days thereafter. Once the animals were sacrificed, the skin of the tail was processed in order to separate the epidermis and prepare in toto mounts. The method used to separate the epidermis from the dermis of the skin of the mice was based on that described by Braun et al. (Braun et al., Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130 (21), 5241-5255, 2003). Once the tail was separated from the body, an incision was made, using a scalpel, in the ventral area, the skin being manually split in a single piece, which was incubated in 10 ml of 5 mM EDTA in PBS for 4 h at 37° C. Subsequently, the epidermis was carefully separated in a single sheet wherefrom the pilose follicles (PFs) hung, and fixed in formaldehyde (3.7% in PBS at 4° C.) for 48 h for the preparation of the in toto mounts. Finally, the epidermis sheets were abundantly washed with PBS phosphate buffer, stored in PBS with 0.2% sodium azide at 4° C. In order to prepare the in toto mounts, epidermis pieces of about 0.5×0.5 cm 2 were cut. [0034] In order to identify and quantify the LRCs in the in toto mounts of the epidermis pieces, the BrdU-positive cells were located by means of immunofluorescence with the adequate antibodies. The samples were evaluated in a Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS spectral confocal microscope. The images were obtained using the LCS Suite software version 2.61 (Leica) and processed with the Photoshop CS2 programme version 9.0.2 (Adobe). The quantification of the number of LRCs was performed on the basis of the images obtained, considering a sample size of 30 follicles per mouse and a minimum of 5 mice per group.'.\n",

[0013] Moreover, said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, promotes the mobilisation of skin stem cells, which translates into the passage thereof from the basal area of pilose follicles to the interfollicular epithelium and distribution therein. The pilose follicle is the part of the skin where stem cells concentrate. [0014] The spawn wherefrom the product of the present invention is prepared were obtained from gastropods grown in greenhouses protected from excess light, direct rain and aggressions by animals and insects. The climate and the protection offered by the greenhouse made it possible for the snails to be under optimal temperature and humidity conditions. The gastropods were fed with fodder, water and green plants, radishes and vegetables, and performed their natural hibernation and reproduction cycles. [0015] The gastropods of the family Helicidae used for the preparation of the product in question are selected from the group that comprises Helix aspersa, Helix pomatia, Helix lucarum, Helix lutescens, Helix hortensis, Helix aperta, Helix pisana, Otala punctata, Iberus gualtieranus alonensis, Helix nemoralis, Helix fructicola, Helix strigella, Helix fruticum, Helix bidens, Helix arbostorum, Helix rotundata, Helix aculeata, Helix pulchella, Helix personata, Helix holoserica, Helix alonensis and Helix candidissima. [0016] The process of obtaining the product derived from snail spawn of the present invention is described below. During their reproductive period, snails deposit their spawn in terracotta flower-pot receptacles containing soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 18° C.-24° C. and 60%-100% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0017] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2° C. and 8° C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration ranging between 40% and 70% (w/w), in purified water, or saline solution, or a component or combination of components of the definitive dermo-cosmetic formulation; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a grinder, colloidal mill or in-line homogeniser; filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh, and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of the suitable dermo-cosmetic preparations. [0018] The final concentration of the product derived from snail spawn in the definitive dermo-cosmetic composition may range between 0.1% and 70% (w/w).

EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of the Product and of a Topical Composition that Contains it as an Active Ingredient [0022] During reproduction, snails deposit their spawn in flowerpots that contain soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 21° C. and approximately 80% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0023] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2° C. and 8° C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration of 70% (w/w), in purified water; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a Silverson mill; they are filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of a cream, using it at a 70% concentration. Example 2 Evaluation of the Activity of the Product Derived from Snail Spawn on the Dynamics of Skin Stem Cells [0024] Since stem cells in the adult epidermis divide infrequently, they are identified with cells that retain a specific DNA label (DNA label-retaining cells, LRCs). The cells that are undergoing division in an animal model (mouse) may be labelled by means of repeated pulses of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or titriated 3 H-thymidine. The label will be progressively lost following the successive divisions; however, keratinocytes that divide very infrequently (slow-cycling keratinocytes) retain the label for long periods of time (LRCs) (Bickenbach J R, McCutecheon J, Mackenzie I C. Rate of loss of tritiated thymidine label in basal cells in mouse epithelial tissues. Cell Tissue Kinet. 19(3): 325-333, 1986; Cotsarelis G, Sun T T, Lavker R M. Label-retaining cells reside in the bulge area of pilosebaceous unit: implications for follicular stem cells, hair cycle, and skin carcinogenesis. Cell. 61(7): 1329-1337, 1990). LRCs are preferably located in the bulge area, or prominent region, of the pilose follicles of the murine epidermis (Fuchs E, Tumbar T, Guasch G. Socializing with the neighbors: stem cells and their niche. Cell. 116(6): 769-778, 2004). The stem cells in the bulge are bipotential, since they may lead to both follicle keratinocytes and a cell population with a high division capacity, called transit-amplifying cells (TA). TAs migrate to the interfollicular epidermis and progressively show a lower differentiation potential; finally, they divide, leading to terminal differentiation keratinocytes. Occasionally, TAs have been considered to be stem cells, since they have a high proliferative potential. However, many authors indicate that only the cells in the bulge should be called stem cells, whereas those in the interfollicular epidermis would be the TAs. [0025] The efficacy of the product derived from snail spawn, obtained as indicated in Example 1, was evaluated by applying it onto the skin of newborn C57BL/6 mice in the form of a cosmetic composition (cream). [0026] The effect of the product in question on the proliferation and migration of epidermal stem cells was analysed; to this end, 30 newborn C57BL/6 mice were used, distributed in three groups, establishing a minimum of 5 animals per group: Group C: Control (untreated animals). Group M1: Animals treated with Sample 1 (cosmetic composition that contains the product derived from the snail spawn). Group M2: Animals treated with Sample 2 (cosmetic composition with the same vehicle as Sample 1 which does not contain the product derived from the snail spawn). [0030] The experiments were performed in accordance with the standards regulating the manipulation and protection of laboratory animals (Royal Decree 1201/2005). [0031] The method used in this study to identify and quantify epidermal stem cells is based on the low proliferation frequency of this cell type with respect to the remaining cell populations in the tissue (Braun K M, Niemann C, Jensen U B, Sundberg J P, Silva-Vargas V, Watt F M. Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130(21): 5241-5255, 2003). [0032] The cells undergoing division may be labelled by means of injections of tritiated thymidine ([ 3 H]thymidine) or 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU), which are thymidine analogues, such that the labelled nucleotides are incorporated into the DNA replication process. After a short period of time (about 24 h) from the administration of a single dose of the analogue to an adult animal, the label is detected in the cells with the highest proliferation rate ( FIG. 2 a ). The cells with the highest division rate are identified in the stratum basale of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), sebaceous gland (SG), infundibulum (Inf) and, especially, the pilose bulb (BP), whereas the quiescent cells of the prominent region or “bulge” (PR) remain unlabelled ( FIG. 2 a ). If the labelling injections are serial and sufficiently numerous, those cells with a low proliferation rate (potential adult stem cells) may also incorporate the label into the chromatin by means of processes other than replication, involved in the repair and maintenance of the DNA double strand ( FIG. 2 b ). Several months after the last of the serial injections, the label is diluted in most cells as a result of the successive DNA replication cycles, whereas those cells with a minimal proliferation rate remain labelled for at least 10 weeks; for this reason, they are called label-retaining cells (LRCs). In the adult epidermis at rest, which primarily contains pilose follicles in the telogen or resting phase, the primary location of LRCs is the so-called prominent region (“bulge”) of the pilose follicle ( FIG. 2 c ). [0033] Once a day, for four consecutive days, the 10-day-old mice received an injection of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (6.25 mg/ml, 50 mg/kg of body weight) in PBS phosphate buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 ), in order to label those cells that were in the DNA replication phase. Approximately 50 days after the labelling with BrdU, Samples 1 and 2, in their cream form, were topically applied twice a day, for 11 consecutive days, on the skin of the tails of the mice. Subsequently, these animals and their corresponding controls were sacrificed in a CO 2 chamber, in two different series for each group (five mice per group and series): immediately following the treatment, or ten days thereafter. Once the animals were sacrificed, the skin of the tail was processed in order to separate the epidermis and prepare in toto mounts. The method used to separate the epidermis from the dermis of the skin of the mice was based on that described by Braun et al. (Braun et al., Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130 (21), 5241-5255, 2003). Once the tail was separated from the body, an incision was made, using a scalpel, in the ventral area, the skin being manually split in a single piece, which was incubated in 10 ml of 5 mM EDTA in PBS for 4 h at 37° C. Subsequently, the epidermis was carefully separated in a single sheet wherefrom the pilose follicles (PFs) hung, and fixed in formaldehyde (3.7% in PBS at 4° C.) for 48 h for the preparation of the in toto mounts. Finally, the epidermis sheets were abundantly washed with PBS phosphate buffer, stored in PBS with 0.2% sodium azide at 4° C. In order to prepare the in toto mounts, epidermis pieces of about 0.5×0.5 cm 2 were cut. [0034] In order to identify and quantify the LRCs in the in toto mounts of the epidermis pieces, the BrdU-positive cells were located by means of immunofluorescence with the adequate antibodies. The samples were evaluated in a Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS spectral confocal microscope. The images were obtained using the LCS Suite software version 2.61 (Leica) and processed with the Photoshop CS2 programme version 9.0.2 (Adobe). The quantification of the number of LRCs was performed on the basis of the images obtained, considering a sample size of 30 follicles per mouse and a minimum of 5 mice per group.'.\n",

      "Changed 'cells' by 'balloon' in '[0001] The present invention relates to a product obtained from gastropod spawn, to be used in the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions capable of activating and mobilising skin stem cells, as well as preventing the loss thereof that takes place as a consequence of chronological and/or premature ageing of the skin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] The skin is the largest organ in the human, or animal, body. It acts as a protective barrier that isolates the body from the surrounding medium, protecting it and contributing to preserve its structures intact, whilst acting as a communication system with the environment. The skin has three layers: the epidermis, which is the most superficial layer, the dermis, which is the intermediate layer, and the hypodermis or subcutaneous tissue, which is the deepest layer of the skin. [0003] Since it is the outermost organ, the skin is subjected to significant deterioration and aggression, which leads to premature ageing of the skin. The external factors that act thereon include excess solar radiation, atmospheric contamination, abusive use of surfactants, tobacco smoke, etc. But the skin may also suffer from premature ageing as a result of internal or endogenous factors, such as those related to an unbalanced nutrition in terms of vitamins, iatrogenic factors such as radiotherapy, the intake of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, etc., or the presence in the body of very reactive toxins such as those ingested by drug addicts, alcoholics, etc. Natural ageing also occurs as a consequence, for example, of the production of free radicals in the mitochondria, DNA alterations, etc. [0004] Deterioration of the skin appears in the form of wrinkles, spots, laxity, benign neoplasms, etc. [0005] Numerous cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions have been disclosed for treatment of the skin, and the care and cleaning thereof, composed of very different ingredients, which include plant extracts and animal extracts. In this regard, one of the ingredients used in the preparation of skin care cosmetics have been gastropod secretions, what is commonly referred to as snail slime. Thus, for example, document DE1813154 discloses a composition designed for skin care that contains a fat and one or more active agents, which contains the slippery lubricating secretion excreted by a snail, particularly Helix pomatia. Patent FR2595247 discloses that extracts from the mucous membranes or digestive juices of gastropods are useful in cosmetics at concentrations ranging between 0.1%-10% due to their moisturising action on the epidermal surface. U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,740 discloses an active ingredient for cosmetic or therapeutic compositions obtained from the secretion of a centrifuged live gastropod, and said compositions may be applied to skin care. [0006] On the other hand, document CA2611645 discloses the use of a Helix aspersa “snail slime” product to stimulate the proliferation of stem cells in vitro. [0007] A stem cell is a cell that has the capacity to renew itself by means of mitotic divisions or to continue the differentiation pathway for which it is programmed. Moreover, it is capable of producing cells of one or more mature, functional, fully differentiated tissues, as a function of its degree of multipotentiality. Most of the tissues of an adult individual have their own specific population of stem cells which allow for their periodical renewal or their regeneration when tissue damage occurs. In particular, the epidermis undergoes constant renewal and consists of a stratified squamous epithelium associated with pilose follicles and sebaceous glands. These specialised structures are maintained by the self-renewal of epidermal stem cells and the differentiation of the offspring thereof. Skin stem cells are crucial for the healing of wounds and the regeneration of the skin and the hair. However, the capacity of stem cells may be diminished due to genetic problems, environmental influences and the ageing process. Therefore, the protection of stem cells is extremely important. [0008] Although snail secretions are known to be useful for the preparation of skin cosmetics, thus far no product derived from snail spawn has been disclosed for the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions that has a proven action on skin stem cells, activating and mobilising them, thereby preventing the loss thereof and, consequently, preventing and correcting ageing of the skin. [0009] In this regard, the present invention discloses a product obtained from gastropod spawn for the preparation of cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions which has been shown to have very beneficial effects on the skin, preventing and correcting the ageing thereof by acting directly on epithelial stem cells. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0010] The object of the present invention consists of a product prepared from gastropod spawn of the family Helicidae, which is used for the preparation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical compositions for the skin. Said product has the capacity to act on stem cells, activating and mobilising them, thereby preventing the loss thereof as a consequence of ageing of the skin caused by both endogenous and exogenous stressful factors. [0011] The product is composed of organic and inorganic molecules from snail spawn, the organic molecules being polysaccharides, proteins, glycoproteins, peptides and amino acids, where the proteins and glycoproteins present a characteristic electrophoretic pattern, similar to that shown in FIG. 1 , and the inorganic molecules being cations and anions such as phosphate, calcium, sodium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper and selenium, in their most stable ion forms. [0012] The product derived from snail spawn is used in the preparation of dermo-cosmetic compositions in the form of serum, solutions, injectables (monodose), gel (Hydragel), o/w gel-cream, w/o gel-cream, o/w cream, w/o cream, w/s cream, o/w/o cream, extemporaneous facial mask preparations, patches and, in general, all dermo-cosmetic (cosmeceutical) forms that may be used in the formulation of dermatological, cosmetic or cosmeceutical products. Said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, facilitates the rescue of skin stem cells intended to disappear due to senescence or endogenous or exogenous aggressions, and promotes the activation of said cells, as shown in Example 2 of the present specification. This activation is characterised by premature induction of DNA replication during cell division. [0013] Moreover, said product, when applied in the form of a dermo-cosmetic composition, promotes the mobilisation of skin stem cells, which translates into the passage thereof from the basal area of pilose follicles to the interfollicular epithelium and distribution therein. The pilose follicle is the part of the skin where stem cells concentrate. [0014] The spawn wherefrom the product of the present invention is prepared were obtained from gastropods grown in greenhouses protected from excess light, direct rain and aggressions by animals and insects. The climate and the protection offered by the greenhouse made it possible for the snails to be under optimal temperature and humidity conditions. The gastropods were fed with fodder, water and green plants, radishes and vegetables, and performed their natural hibernation and reproduction cycles. [0015] The gastropods of the family Helicidae used for the preparation of the product in question are selected from the group that comprises Helix aspersa, Helix pomatia, Helix lucarum, Helix lutescens, Helix hortensis, Helix aperta, Helix pisana, Otala punctata, Iberus gualtieranus alonensis, Helix nemoralis, Helix fructicola, Helix strigella, Helix fruticum, Helix bidens, Helix arbostorum, Helix rotundata, Helix aculeata, Helix pulchella, Helix personata, Helix holoserica, Helix alonensis and Helix candidissima. [0016] The process of obtaining the product derived from snail spawn of the present invention is described below. During their reproductive period, snails deposit their spawn in terracotta flower-pot receptacles containing soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 18° C.-24° C. and 60%-100% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean. [0017] The spawn are immersed in saline solution and kept refrigerated at between 2° C. and 8° C. Subsequently, the saline solution is filtered through a mesh with a diameter of less than 3 mm, such that only intact snail spawn remain. The spawn are washed with purified water and, thereafter, are suspended, at a concentration ranging between 40% and 70% (w/w), in purified water, or saline solution, or a component or combination of components of the definitive dermo-cosmetic formulation; they are lysed and homogenised by means of a grinder, colloidal mill or in-line homogeniser; filtered through a 1-mm steel mesh, and the liquid thus obtained (product of the present invention) is used in the manufacturing of the suitable dermo-cosmetic preparations. [0018] The final concentration of the product derived from snail spawn in the definitive dermo-cosmetic composition may range between 0.1% and 70% (w/w).

EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of the Product and of a Topical Composition that Contains it as an Active Ingredient [0022] During reproduction, snails deposit their spawn in flowerpots that contain soil sieved through 2-mm-pore sieves. Once the snail spawn have been laid, the collection phase is performed at an approximate temperature of 21° C. and approximately 80% humidity. During this collection phase, the content of the flowerpots is deposited in 3-mm sieves, where the soil is cleaned and eliminated. The spawn are rinsed with distilled water at a very low pressure, such that, during the rinsings, all the soil goes through the sieve, leaving the spawn perfectly clean.

Example 2 Evaluation of the Activity of the Product Derived from Snail Spawn on the Dynamics of Skin Stem Cells [0024] Since stem cells in the adult epidermis divide infrequently, they are identified with cells that retain a specific DNA label (DNA label-retaining cells, LRCs). The cells that are undergoing division in an animal model (mouse) may be labelled by means of repeated pulses of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or titriated 3 H-thymidine. The label will be progressively lost following the successive divisions; however, keratinocytes that divide very infrequently (slow-cycling keratinocytes) retain the label for long periods of time (LRCs) (Bickenbach J R, McCutecheon J, Mackenzie I C. Rate of loss of tritiated thymidine label in basal cells in mouse epithelial tissues. Cell Tissue Kinet. 19(3): 325-333, 1986; Cotsarelis G, Sun T T, Lavker R M. Label-retaining cells reside in the bulge area of pilosebaceous unit: implications for follicular stem cells, hair cycle, and skin carcinogenesis. Cell. 61(7): 1329-1337, 1990). LRCs are preferably located in the bulge area, or prominent region, of the pilose follicles of the murine epidermis (Fuchs E, Tumbar T, Guasch G. Socializing with the neighbors: stem cells and their niche. Cell. 116(6): 769-778, 2004). The stem cells in the bulge are bipotential, since they may lead to both follicle keratinocytes and a cell population with a high division capacity, called transit-amplifying cells (TA). TAs migrate to the interfollicular epidermis and progressively show a lower differentiation potential; finally, they divide, leading to terminal differentiation keratinocytes. Occasionally, TAs have been considered to be stem cells, since they have a high proliferative potential. However, many authors indicate that only the cells in the bulge should be called stem cells, whereas those in the interfollicular epidermis would be the TAs. [0025] The efficacy of the product derived from snail spawn, obtained as indicated in Example 1, was evaluated by applying it onto the skin of newborn C57BL/6 mice in the form of a cosmetic composition (cream). [0026] The effect of the product in question on the proliferation and migration of epidermal stem cells was analysed; to this end, 30 newborn C57BL/6 mice were used, distributed in three groups, establishing a minimum of 5 animals per group: Group C: Control (untreated animals). Group M1: Animals treated with Sample 1 (cosmetic composition that contains the product derived from the snail spawn). Group M2: Animals treated with Sample 2 (cosmetic composition with the same vehicle as Sample 1 which does not contain the product derived from the snail spawn). [0030] The experiments were performed in accordance with the standards regulating the manipulation and protection of laboratory animals (Royal Decree 1201/2005). [0031] The method used in this study to identify and quantify epidermal stem cells is based on the low proliferation frequency of this cell type with respect to the remaining cell populations in the tissue (Braun K M, Niemann C, Jensen U B, Sundberg J P, Silva-Vargas V, Watt F M. Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130(21): 5241-5255, 2003). [0032] The cells undergoing division may be labelled by means of injections of tritiated thymidine ([ 3 H]thymidine) or 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU), which are thymidine analogues, such that the labelled nucleotides are incorporated into the DNA replication process. After a short period of time (about 24 h) from the administration of a single dose of the analogue to an adult animal, the label is detected in the cells with the highest proliferation rate ( FIG. 2 a ). The cells with the highest division rate are identified in the stratum basale of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), sebaceous gland (SG), infundibulum (Inf) and, especially, the pilose bulb (BP), whereas the quiescent cells of the prominent region or “bulge” (PR) remain unlabelled ( FIG. 2 a ). If the labelling injections are serial and sufficiently numerous, those cells with a low proliferation rate (potential adult stem cells) may also incorporate the label into the chromatin by means of processes other than replication, involved in the repair and maintenance of the DNA double strand ( FIG. 2 b ). Several months after the last of the serial injections, the label is diluted in most cells as a result of the successive DNA replication cycles, whereas those cells with a minimal proliferation rate remain labelled for at least 10 weeks; for this reason, they are called label-retaining cells (LRCs). In the adult epidermis at rest, which primarily contains pilose follicles in the telogen or resting phase, the primary location of LRCs is the so-called prominent region (“bulge”) of the pilose follicle ( FIG. 2 c ). [0033] Once a day, for four consecutive days, the 10-day-old mice received an injection of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (6.25 mg/ml, 50 mg/kg of body weight) in PBS phosphate buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 ), in order to label those cells that were in the DNA replication phase. Approximately 50 days after the labelling with BrdU, Samples 1 and 2, in their cream form, were topically applied twice a day, for 11 consecutive days, on the skin of the tails of the mice. Subsequently, these animals and their corresponding controls were sacrificed in a CO 2 chamber, in two different series for each group (five mice per group and series): immediately following the treatment, or ten days thereafter. Once the animals were sacrificed, the skin of the tail was processed in order to separate the epidermis and prepare in toto mounts. The method used to separate the epidermis from the dermis of the skin of the mice was based on that described by Braun et al. (Braun et al., Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis. Development. 130 (21), 5241-5255, 2003). Once the tail was separated from the body, an incision was made, using a scalpel, in the ventral area, the skin being manually split in a single piece, which was incubated in 10 ml of 5 mM EDTA in PBS for 4 h at 37° C. Subsequently, the epidermis was carefully separated in a single sheet wherefrom the pilose follicles (PFs) hung, and fixed in formaldehyde (3.7% in PBS at 4° C.) for 48 h for the preparation of the in toto mounts. Finally, the epidermis sheets were abundantly washed with PBS phosphate buffer, stored in PBS with 0.2% sodium azide at 4° C. In order to prepare the in toto mounts, epidermis pieces of about 0.5×0.5 cm 2 were cut. [0034] In order to identify and quantify the LRCs in the in toto mounts of the epidermis pieces, the BrdU-positive cells were located by means of immunofluorescence with the adequate antibodies. The samples were evaluated in a Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS spectral confocal microscope. The images were obtained using the LCS Suite software version 2.61 (Leica) and processed with the Photoshop CS2 programme version 9.0.2 (Adobe). The quantification of the number of LRCs was performed on the basis of the images obtained, considering a sample size of 30 follicles per mouse and a minimum of 5 mice per group.'.\n",

      "Changed 'pressure' by 'using' in 'TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to devices for controlling and dividing the flow of fluids, and more particularly relates to devices for metering and placement of anhydrous ammonia in agricultural fields for fertilizer. BACKGROUND ART Anhydrous ammonia is not only the nitrogen source for most synthetic fertilizers but also is commonly applied directly to the ground in its natural state for grain crops (corn, milo, wheat, etc.). Ammonia is typically stored in a pressure vessel in its liquified gas phase, where it is a liquid due to its own vapor pressure. Heat flow into the system will be absorbed in the system by additional formation of vapor, increasing system pressure. Heat flow out of the system will produce condensation of vapor, reducing system pressure. The application and distribution of ammonia for fertilizer is usually accomplished by a tractor equipped with a tool bar or cultivator. The ammonia is metered and placed into a plurality of spaced rows, 4 inches to 8 inches beneath the soil&#39;s surface, and the soil is sealed. Typically, a tractor tows an ammonia nurse tank wagon behind the tool bar, and suitable flexible connections are provided to transfer ammonia from the tank through a meter on the tool bar into a manifold, where flow is divided and fed into the soil through hoses and applicator knives. The energy required to move ammonia through the system is supplied by its vapor pressure in the tank, however, ammonia moving from the tank to the meter experiences a pressure drop equal to the pressure head required to accelerate ammonia to its velocity through the system. This pressure drop requires a temperature reduction in the system which is provided by refrigeration or vaporization within the system. The colder the day, the lower the tank pressure, and the greater the distance from the tank to the meter--the greater the percentage of vapor in the system prior to metering. Vapor in the system prior to metering degrades the accuracy of the metering function. Operations using larger, more powerful tractors available today, capable of pulling wider tool bars at greater speeds across fields, have often outrun capacities of control systems during late fall and early spring cold weather applications. This condition prevails not only with tool bar-mounted mechanical meters but also electrically-controlled meters due to unknown system resistance from the nurse tank to the tool bar mounted meter. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,364,409, Dec. 21, 1982, Fluid Flow Control Device, James S. Jones, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Thus, as ammonia is fed through the application system by its own vapor pressure, it experiences an ever changing set of conditions as it moves through the system. A system at rest (no product moving in or out) has a thermal balance; the thermal energy in equals the thermal energy out. On demand of product the product moves up the dip tube forming an efflux at the entrance of the dip tube. This acceleration requires a drop in temperature reflected by the dew point of the product at the tank pressure and the dew point of the product that has been accelerated a the entrance of the dip tube. This drop in temperature is provided by the formation of vapor within the system. This reaction is repeated at every restriction as the product moves through the system--the withdrawal valve, the hose end valve (or reader), the safety coupling, the shut-off valve, the meter (or throttle), the manifold outlet fittings and the discharge tube on the knives. Unlike a true liquid system where the points of restrictions can be considered orifices in series and where one value can be established for all of the points of restrictions, an ammonia system must deal with each restriction individually. It is known to utilize vapor stripping prior to metering, which works very well in the mid-upper range of application. The gray area is in the low range of applications where stripping dumps first open. Over-stripping may occur, which reduces the system&#39;s dew point by refrigeration, and ammonia across the metering point behaves like a liquid rather than a liquified gas resulting in over-application at lower application rates on small grains using narrow tool bars. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,657,568 Apparatus For Volumetrically Controlling The Flow Of A Gas And Liquid Mixture, James S. Jones, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Prior apparatus for dividing flow has been acceptable for high outputs required for larger grains, grown usually in 30 inch rows and requiring 200 pounds N or more per acre; however, uneven distribution is not uncommon with small grains with larger tool bars on the rolling hills often found in wheat country. A 45 foot tool bar used for corn, with 30 inch rows having 18 knives applying 200 pounds N per acre, is a much simpler distribution problem than the same tool bar used for wheat, with 12 inch rows, 45 knives, and 75 pounds N per acre. A two manifold system has been used with corn with limited success; however, in wheat, two manifolds with the present systems becomes a disaster. The best present art is a controlled manifold. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,807,663, David Ward and James S. Jones, Feb. 28, 1989, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In an effort to even out the pressure difference across each row a constant hose length for each row is typically used. So, with a 45 foot tool bar in corn, in excess of 400 feet of applicator hose is required; with wheat, in excess of 1,000 feet is required. A fairly common problem in applying ammonia is the finishing off of a field with a strip less wide than the width of the tool bar. For example, a farmer may apply an entire field in 40 foot wide strips with a 40 foot wide tool bar, but end up with a 30 foot wide remainder. Presently, his only choices would be to leave the remainder untreated or to overtreat a 10 foot strip. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention includes hardware that interfaces with existing microprocessors or on-board computers of farm vehicles to provide a system for management of metering and distribution of liquid ammonia used as fertilizer. The position of a butterfly disc is read at the outlet of the nurse tank to determine the quantity of product flowing. A throttling device, mounted on the tool bar, is positioned electronically to match the requirement signal from a microprocessor or computer with the signal from butterfly disc reader to provide and control the total product flow. Non-electrical means divides total product either through a manifold having an outlet for each row or into two, three, four, or more streams to feed manifolds for sections of the tool bar. Thus, the improved management system is actuated by demand signals received from a computer on-board the tractor pulling the system. These demand signals vary directly with the speed of the rig. The novel components of the system include a throttling device immediately upstream from one or more distribution manifolds and an ammonia flow reader immediately downstream from the ammonia tank. The throttling device is controlled electronically by comparing the demand signals from the computer with signals received from the ammonia flow reader. The formation of vapor downstream of the flow rate read has been found to affect only maximum capacity of the system and not the accuracy of the reader. Thus, flow rate is read as close to the source as practical, between the nurse tank&#39;s withdrawal valve and the supply hose to the tool bar, with the throttle located on the tool bar, leaving only the variables between the bottom end of the dip tube and the outlet of the withdrawal valve that will affect the first dimension control (pounds product over acres). The reader butterfly disc is unbalanced to the open position by an offset butterfly shaft and a pressure difference across will open and keep it in contact with the stop pin. Through one end of the butterfly shaft is a position pick-up pin that is perpendicular to the butterfly, whose position is read electronically across a sealing plate of proper material. Attached to the upper end of the stop pin is a diaphragm with a closing spring above it. The bottom side of the diaphragm has communication with the product upstream of the butterfly. The top side of the diaphragm also has communication with the product downstream of the butterfly but across a pressure differential control having a diaphragm which reads the upstream pressure on its bottom side and the downstream pressure on its top side. Upon product demand, a pressure drop occurs downstream of the butterfly. When this pressure drop reaches the control point, the control diaphragm moves up against the control spring and opens a small valve that throttles the product across the top side of the larger diaphragm to position the stop pin against the closing spring. The small diaphragm reads the pressure difference across the butterfly and positions the stop pin to provide a constant pressure difference regardless of product demand. The quantity of product is determined by the computer and electronically positions the throttling device which is mounted on the tool bar. The outlet of the reader is provided with a manually operated ball valve which is to be opened only when the reader is attached to the withdrawal valve. The product leaves the flow rate reader through a hose over to the tool bar and flows through a safety coupling through a short hose through a hydraulic ball valve into the throttling device. The throttling device receives product from the bottom into a round bore where it meets the throttling piston which is normally closed. Upon demand for product, a duty cycle solenoid receives the proper throttling signal from the computer and allows a flow of product across a restricting orifice providing the pressure difference across the throttle diaphragm to open and position the throttling piston for the proper area to supply the product demand. The duty cycle solenoid pulses off and on about ten times per second with a varying on/off ratio. This throttles the flow of the pilot charge to position the throttle. When the flow is greater across the solenoid than the orifice, the throttle is opening. When the flow is equal across the orifice and solenoid, the throttle remains fixed. To enhance the operation of the duty cycle solenoid, a pressure differential limit valve is placed at the discharge side and limits the pressure differential to 15-20 PSI as the pilot charge moves to the waste outlet on its way to one of the applicator knives where it is placed in the soil. The arrangement of the pilot charge pick up encourages the removal of vapor from the system, which vapor is due to the filter and screen bed and the difference in velocities from the entrance and the restricting orifice. A magnet is placed downstream of the orifice to strip and retain iron oxide from the pilot charge to prevent contamination of the solenoid. The flow divider divides the flow into three or four streams. The product requirement for each stream may not be equal. A 50 foot tool bar having 50 knives would require: one-fourth of 50 equals 12.5, one-third of 50 equals 16.66. With four divisions, two manifolds would require 13 outlets and two manifolds would require 12 outlets, and with three divisions two manifolds would require 17 outlets and one manifold would require 16 outlets. A thirty-six foot tool bar with four streams would require four manifolds with 9 outlets and three streams would require three manifolds with 12 outlets. The pressure difference across the dividing ports is controlled independently and is not affected by upstream or downstream pressures; therefore, the systems can be tailored to accommodate the different requirements by altering the pressure differentials. For example, in a rig requiring two manifolds with 12 outlets and two manifolds with 13 outlets, a base pressure differential of 9.0 PSI could be used with the 12 outlet manifolds while the 13 outlet manifolds would require (13/12) 2 ×9.0 or a pressure differential of 10.6 PSI. This would be accomplished by providing a spacer under the control spring of two of the differential pressure controls. The total product flowing as controlled by the computer and read by the butterfly position enters the divider port area where the flow is divided across the ports, then throttled independently to the proper pressure differential to supply each stream with the proper product. The divider valve is nylon with a bullet shaped nose that is received by a cone-like seat and is throttled by the pressure difference across a diaphragm that is positioned by a flow of product, taken upstream of the divider ports, and throttled from the control diaphragm chamber to the pressure chamber, where is acts on the divider diaphragm to position the divider throttle, then flows across a restricting orifice to the outlet. The spring side of the control diaphragm has communication with the area between the dividing port and the throttle valve, allowing the control diaphragm to read and control the pressure difference across the port. As an optional feature, the pressure differential controls may be fitted with a solenoid in the pilot discharge leg. When the solenoid is closed, the upstream pressure acts on the throttle diaphragm to close the throttle valve. While this valve is not intended to serve as the system&#39;s shutdown valve, it will do an excellent job of shutting down tool bar sections to finish out fields or can be used for shutdown for the turnaround. A compact manifold is used with the system having different diameter outlet rings to accommodate the different outlet requirements placing the orifices for the outlets as close to one another as practical. This system of management of the product across the tool bar is very dependable and accurate and eliminates the need of extremely long applicator hoses which pick up a lot of uneven heat flow, which increase the back pressure of the hoses with the greater heat input and affects the distribution, especially on the lower outputs required by the small grains. The biggest pressure drop of this system occurs either (1) just after product has been divided to feed separate sections of the tool bar, or alternatively, (2) just before the product enters a controlled manifold which feeds the entire tool bar. This pressure drop at the system&#39;s throttling device is controlled electronically to match a demand signal from the on-board computer with the ammonia flow reader which is at the inlet end of the system. In the ammonia flow reader, the position of a butterfly valve having a constant pressure head across it determines the quantity of product. The butterfly valve is located as near the tank&#39;s withdrawal valve as practical to provide it with the product having experienced the least physical change due to the thermodynamic properties of ammonia. This method of reading the flow of a liquified gas has less error than a method that attempts to read volume, such as a turbine or paddle-wheel flow meter.

Throttling device 2 is mounted at the outlet of ball valve 14. Manifold ring 21 at the outlet of the throttling device 2 has the proper number of outlets to match the multiple applicator knives 22 with the proper hoses 23 between ring 21 and knives 22. For clarity, only one knife 22 and hose 23 are shown in FIG. 1. Tractor A is equipped with an on-board computer F and has a sensor G to determine ground speed. Reader 1 and throttling device 2 are interconnected with computer F by way of cables 24. The factors required to meter ammonia are: 1. a variable factor, ammonia flow per unit time, measured by ammonia flow reader 1; 2. row width, a constant; 3. number of rows, a constant; 4. desired pounds N per acre, a constant; and 5. the variable ground speed measured by speed sensor G. The demand signal at a given instant represents the constants multiplied times the measured ground speed.'.\n",

      "Changed 'upper' by 'include' in 'CROSS-REFERENCES [0001] The present application is filed with reference to a patent issued to inventor, Christopher Loney, on Nov. 15, 2011, U.S. Pat. No. 8,056,982 and titled “Compactable, collapsible chair”. Christopher Loney is the sole inventor of the 2011 patent and this invention. This invention is an improvement of his 2011 patent. This invention incorporates the compatibility and collapsibility of the chair and adds the self-aligning feature of the chair. The self-aligning feature incorporates elastic bands inside the frame. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The invention pertains to a collapsible seating structures and, more particularly, to a chair having a rigid, collapsible frame having reduced dimensions in a collapsed state allowing the compacted, collapsed chair to be carried in a back pack or rolled up and not requiring a bag. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Many outdoor activities are greatly enhanced by the use of a portable seat or back support structure. While many such devices have been proposed in the prior art, all suffer from the limitations of bulk and/or weight. While many prior art structures may be folded or collapsed for transportation or storage, the rigid frames thereof retain their original dimensions. Consequently, the frame dimensions of such prior art chairs or seats, even in the folded or collapsed configuration are not reduced and the degree of compaction of such structures is thereby limited. In other words, when such prior art seats are folded or collapsed, they typically retain at least two dimensions (e.g., height and width), of their open, operational dimensions even in their collapsed state. When the activity for which a seat or backrest is required occurs a distance from a transportation source, the collapsed dimensions of prior art structures still present logistical problems due to their bulk when hand carrying them to the site of the activity. Discussion of the Related Art [0004] Several attempts at providing portable and/or collapsible seating or backrest structures may be found in the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 1,799,939 for CONVERTIBLE GROUND SEAT AND LOUNGE, issued Apr. 7, 1931 to Claude Beauchamp Wainwright et al. discloses a portable seating structure collapsible along a single dimension. [0005] U.S. Pat. No. 2,570,571 for COMBINATION BACK REST AND BAG STRUCTURE, issued Oct. 9, 1951 to Robert N. Leeman teaches another portable seating arrangement collapsible along a single dimension. [0006] U.S. Pat. No. 2,816,599 for COMBINATION SUPPORT AND BAG, issued Dec. 17, 1957 to Marjory M. Adams discloses another seat/backrest structure collapsible along a single dimension and having a carrying bag which, in addition to facilitating carrying the ADAMS seat, functions as seat and back support surfaces. [0007] U.S. Pat. No. 4,736,825 for COMBINATION TOTE BAG AND BODY REST, issued Apr. 12, 1988 to Daniel P. Belfi shows another structure collapsible in a single dimension and including an integral tote bag. [0008] U.S. Pat. No. 4,530,451 for COMBINATION BACK PACK/BEACH CHAIR, issued Jul. 23, 1985 to James Hamilton discloses a seat/back rest structure collapsible along a single dimension and having integral straps to facilitate carrying the device on one&#39;s back. [0009] U.S. Pat. No. 5,042,874 for FOLDING BEACH LOUNGE, issued Aug. 27, 1991 to Daniel E. Williams teaches another portable seating device collapsible along a single dimension. Extendable portions my be withdrawn to collapse the WILLIAMS device to a predetermined size rectangular parallelepiped, thereby lowering the height as well as the thickness of the lounge, consequently actually allowing compression of structure size along two dimensions. [0010] U.S. Pat. No. 5,701,979 for BAG THAT MAY BE CONVERTED INTO A FOLDING BACK REST FOR THE BEACH OR PARK, issued Dec. 30, 1997 to Jan Harriet Voich teaches a folding structure that may be compacted into an integral carrying bag. However, the structure collapses only along a single dimension. [0011] Published United States Patent Application No. 2004/0195891 for GROUND LOUNGER, published Oct. 7, 2004 upon application by Clifford Eugene Vaughan, provides yet another folding structure, collapsible along a single dimension. [0012] U.S. Pat. No. 6,902,230 for FOLDABLE CHILD SUPPORT DEVICE, issued Jun. 7, 2005 to Shun-Min Chen, provides a structure having frame members foldable at a mid point thereof so as to compact the structure along both height and a length dimensions. [0013] None of the patents and published patent application, taken singly, or in any combination are seen to teach or suggest the novel self-aligning, compactable, collapsible chair of the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0014] In accordance with the present invention there is provided a self-aligning, compactable, collapsible seating structure wherein dimensions of the chair in an operational, deployed configuration may be reduced along two dimensions (i.e., height, length) into a compacted configuration for storage or transport. The novel chair may be compacted into a thin bundle that is rolled up in and contained within fabric that forms a portion of the chair. In its compacted, rolled up state, the novel chair is suitable for transportation within a backpack or other such enclosure. [0015] It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a seating structure convertible from an operational, deployed configuration to a collapsed configuration. [0016] It is another object of the invention to provide a seating structure convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration wherein both height and length are reduced in the transformation. [0017] It is an additional object of the invention to provide a seating structure having a rigid frame that is convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration. [0018] It is an additional object of the invention to provide a seating structure having a rigid frame that is convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration with no moving parts such as hinged joints or a slide. [0019] It is a further object of the invention to provide a seating structure convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration having a seat-supporting portion and a back-supporting portion, an angle therebetween being adjustable. [0020] It is a still further object of the invention to provide a seating structure convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration having a moisture proof mat portion, when in a collapsed configuration the seating structure may be rolled up within the mat portion. [0021] It is yet another object of the invention to provide a seating structure convertible from an operational configuration to a collapsed configuration having frame members without foldable mid point joints thereof, the frame members being held in a locked configuration by elastic bands inside the frame member tubing with the frame member tubing being held together with male-female connections and connectable ends with expanded and reduced sizes and with a friction fit to form an extended portion. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0022] Various objects, features, and attendant advantages of the present invention will become more fully appreciated as the same becomes better understood when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the several views, and wherein: [0023] FIG. 1 is a perspective, schematic view of the self-aligning, compactable, collapsible chair or seat in accordance with the invention in an open, operational configuration; [0024] FIGS. 2 a and 2 b are side, cross-sectional, schematic views of two embodiments of the seat-supporting and leg-protecting portions of the chair of FIG. 1 ; [0025] FIGS. 3 a , 3 b , and 3 c are top plan, schematic views of a first frame portion of the chair of FIG. 1 in an open, operational configuration, a partially collapsed configuration, and a fully collapsed configuration, respectively; [0026] FIGS. 4 a and 4 b are top plan, schematic views of a second frame portion of the chair of FIG. 1 in an open, operational configuration, and a partially collapsed configuration, respectively; and [0027] FIG. 5 is a perspective, schematic view of the first and second frame portions of the chair of FIG. 1 connected to one another by a rotating pinned joint. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [0028] The present invention provides self-aligning, compactable, collapsible chair structure having a seat-supporting portion and a back-supporting portion connected to one another via a pinned joint, the angle therebetween being adjustable. [0029] Referring first to FIG. 1 , there is shown an isometric view of the self-aligning, compactable, collapsible chair of the present invention in an open, operational configuration, generally at reference number 100. [0030] Chair 100 has a seat/leg-supporting portion 102 consisting of a seat-supporting region 106 and a leg-protecting region 108. Referring now also to FIGS. 2 a and 2 b , there are shown side, cross-sectional, elevational views of two embodiments of seat/leg supporting region 102 of seat 100. [0031] As seen in FIG. 2 a , seat-supporting region 106 is typically a padded structure with a moisture barrier, 110 forming a lower, ground-engaging surface. A wear-resistant membrane 112 forms an upper surface of both leg-protecting region 108 and seat supporting region 106. In a first embodiment, seat-supporting region 106 has a foam pad 114 disposed between water-resistant membrane 110 and wear-resistant membrane 112. While a foam pad 114 has been chosen for purposes of disclosure, it will be recognized by those of skill in the art that many alternate materials may be substituted therefor. Consequently, the invention is not considered limited to the foam pad 114 chosen for purposes of disclosure. Rather, the invention comprehends any and all suitable padding materials. [0032] It will be further recognized that while a two-ply structure consisting of moisture resistant membrane 110 and wear-resistant membrane 112 has been shown, a single-ply structure may readily be substituted therefore. [0033] As seen in FIG. 2 b , an inflatable bladder 116 and an inflation tube and valve 118 replace foam pad 114. The use of an inflatable bladder 116 allows chair 100 to possibly be compacted to a smaller volume than in the embodiment of FIG. 2 a having foam pad 114. Further, inflatable bladder 116 allows a user to adjust a degree of firmness or support of the “padding” provided thereby to a personal preference. Inflatable bladders 116 and inflation tubes and valve structures 118 are considered to be well known to those of skill in the art and art not further described herein. [0034] A back-supporting portion 104 is attached to seat/leg supporting region 102 by a continuation of at least wear resistant membrane 112 or back padding 114. [0035] Referring now to FIGS. 3 a and 3 b , there are shown top plan, schematic views of a frame 120 in an open, operational configuration, and a partially collapsed configuration, respectively. Frame 120 defines and supports back-supporting portion 104 of chair 100. [0036] In its open, operational configuration ( FIG. 3 a ), frame 120 is substantially rectangular having foldable slip apart self-aligning side members 122 a , 122 b , top members 124 a , and a bottom member 126. Foldable side members 122 a , 122 b each have a slip apart self-aligning central connector 128 a , 128 b , respectively, disposed at approximately a midpoint of respective side members 122 a , 122 b along the major axis thereof. Central connectors 128 a , 128 b divide respective side members 122 a , 122 b into upper segments 130 a , 130 b and lower segments 132 a , 132 b. Typically, connectors 128 a , 128 b bisect respective side members 122 a , 122 b causing upper segments 130 a , 130 b and lower segments 132 a , 132 b to be approximately the same length. It will be recognized that other arrangements may be contemplated wherein by changing the placement of connectors 128 a , 128 b , the lengths of upper segments 130 a , 130 b may be different than the lengths of lower segments 132 a , 132 b. Consequently, the invention is not considered limited to the particular placement of connectors 128 a , 128 b along side members 122 a , 122 b , respectively. It will be recognized that upper segments 130 a , 130 b and lower segments 132 a , 132 b form respective continuous members when respective slid apart self-aligning compression fittings are joined 128 a , 128 b are in place. [0037] Corner slip apart self-aligning joints 136 a , 136 b , connect distal ends of lower segments 132 a , 132 b to lower member 126. Likewise, corner slip apart self-aligning joints 136 c , 136 d connect distal ends of upper segments 130 a , 130 b to an upper frame brace 138. Upper frame brace 138 consists of top frame members 124 a and frame brace side members 140 a , 140 b. Corner slip apart self-aligning joints are considered to be well known to those of skill in the art and, consequently, are not further discussed herein. Any suitable compression fitting slip apart self-aligning connection may be used throughout the novel folding chair 100 and the invention is not limited to the compression fitting slip apart self-aligning joints chosen for purposes of disclosure. [0038] FIG. 3 b shows frame 120 in a partially collapsed configuration. Elastic band 145 is shown inside the slip apart lower segments 132 a , 132 b to lower member 126 and upper segments 130 a , 130 b to an upper frame brace 138 , thereby allowing upper segments 130 a , 130 b and lower segments 132 a , 132 b to move inwardly, thereby moving lower frame member 126 upwardly toward upper frame brace 138 in the direction indicated by arrow 142. [0039] Referring now also to FIG. 3 c , frame 120 is shown in a fully collapsed configuration. [0040] Referring now to FIGS. 4 a and 4 b , there are shown top plan, schematic views of a vertical support frame 220 in an open, operable configuration and in a partially collapsed configuration, respectively. Vertical support frame 220 is similar in both construction and operation to frame 120 ( FIGS. 3 a - 3 c ) discussed in detail hereinabove. [0041] In its open, operational configuration ( FIG. 4 a ), frame 220 is also substantially rectangular having foldable side members 222 a , 222 b , top members 124 a and a bottom member 226. Foldable side members 222 a , 222 b each have a slip apart self-aligning joint connectors 228 a , 228 b disposed at approximately a midpoint of respective side members 222 a , 222 b along the major axis thereof. Slip apart self-aligning joints connectors 228 a , 228 b divide respective side members 222 a , 222 b in to upper segments 230 a , 230 b and lower segments 232 a , 232 b. Typically, slip apart self-aligning joint connectors 228 a , 228 b bisect respective side members 222 a , 222 b causing upper segments 230 a , 230 b and lower segments 232 a , 232 b to be substantially the same length. It will be recognized that other arrangements may be contemplated wherein by changing the placement of slip apart self-aligning joint connectors 228 a , 228 b , the lengths of upper segments 230 a , 230 b may be different than the lengths of lower segments 232 a , 232 b. Consequently, the invention is not considered limited to the particular placement of slip apart self-aligning joint connectors 228 a , 228 b along side members 222 a , 222 b , respectively. [0042] Slip apart self-aligning joint connectors 236 a , 236 b , connect distal ends of lower segments 232 a , 232 b to lower member 226. Likewise, slip apart self-aligning joint connectors 236 c , 236 d connect distal ends of upper segments 230 a , 230 b to upper frame members 240 a , 240 b. [0043] FIG. 4 b shows frame 220 in a partially collapsed configuration. Elastic band 145 is shown inside the slip apart upper segments 230 a , 230 b and lower segments 232 a , 232 b , thereby allowing them to move inwardly, thereby moving lower frame member 226 upwardly toward upper frame members 224 a in the direction indicated by arrow 242. [0044] Referring now to FIG. 5 , there is shown a perspective, schematic view of frames 120 and 220 rotatably interconnected into the A-frame structure that forms the complete frame of the novel chair 100. Pivotable interconnections are shown schematically at reference numbers 180. It will be recognized that numerous mechanisms are known to those of skill in the art for pivotably interconnecting frames 120 and 220. Such mechanisms include, but are not limited to, detented mechanism capable of self-locking frames 120 and 220 in discrete, predetermined angular relationships to one another. Such mechanisms are not further described herein. [0045] Flexible straps 182 , typically having one or more grommets 184 may be used to secure the angular relationship of frames 120 and 220. [0046] Other flexible straps 190 a , 190 b are typically fastened to top frame member 224 a and bottom frame member 126. Flexible straps 190 a , 190 b provide back support to a user of chair 100.

      "Changed 'composition' by 'example' in 'FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention is directed to a topical composition comprising a colorant which is an antioxidant. More particularly, the invention is directed to a topical composition for influencing a desirable skin color where the topical composition comprises more than one colorant. A first colorant used is typically a dye or pigment, and the second colorant used is an antioxidant like a lipophilic carotenoid having a log P of greater than about 12.5. The topical composition, surprisingly, has an L* value from about 60 to about 90 and a hue value from about −50 to about 50 for at least about three (3) months and when stored at about ambient temperature. Moreover, such a composition is surprisingly stable in the absence of conventional preservatives that are known to release toxic compounds like formaldehyde. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Cosmetic compositions suitable for changing the appearance of keratinaceous substances like mammalian skin and nails are often desired. Women tend to prefer cosmetics that impart a matte appearance. The matte finish tends to overcome the shiny effect engendered by greasy skin and often creates a physical skin lightening effect generally associated with inorganic particulates. In fact, absorbent fillers like talc, silica, kaolin, and other inorganic particulates have been used to achieve such an effect by their optical properties. This effect is not always desired since many consumers feel traditional compositions are too white and create a non-natural look after application. Furthermore, consumers prefer to apply to their skin (especially their face) compositions that have natural ingredients. In fact, compositions with ingredients naturally found in skin are highly desired, as are compositions that have a desirable color which remains stable in the product. [0003] There is an increasing interest to develop a topical composition that results in a desirable skin color after application. This invention, therefore, is directed to a topical composition for influencing a desirable skin color where the topical composition comprises more than one colorant. The composition comprises a first colorant which is a dye or pigment, and a second colorant that is an antioxidant like a lipophilic carotenoid having a log P of greater than about 12.5. The topical composition of this invention, surprisingly, is free of a brownish color often associated with oxidized carotenoids, and has a L* value from about 60 to about 90 and a hue value from about −50 to about 50 for at least about 3 months when stored at about ambient temperature. The topical composition of this invention is stable, notwithstanding the fact that it is substantially free of conventional preservatives known to release toxic compounds like formaldehyde. Additional Information [0004] Efforts have been disclosed for making cosmetic compositions. In United States Published Application No. 2004/0071745, compositions with at least one carotenoid and at least one isoflavonoid are described, where the compositions are intended for treating the cutaneous signs of aging. [0005] Other efforts have been disclosed for making cosmetic compositions. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,445, compositions with cyclodextrin-complexed beta-carotene and uncomplexed beta-carotene are described. [0006] Still other efforts have been disclosed for making cosmetic compositions. In United States Published Application No. 2006/0171909, a cosmetic composition with an encapsulated dye is described. [0007] None of the additional information above describes a topical composition comprising coloring antioxidants that are naturally found in skin, like a lipophilic carotenoid having a log P of greater than about 12.5. Particularly, none of the additional information describes a topical composition having a stable L* value from about 60 to about 90 and a hue value from about −50 to about 50 where the color of the composition is the result of a combination of at least one of a dye or pigment, and a lipophilic carotenoid having a log P of greater than about 12.5. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0008] In the first aspect, the present invention is directed to a composition for influencing skin color comprising: [0009] (a) a first colorant comprising dye, pigment or both; and [0010] (b) a second colorant; [0011] the second colorant being an antioxidant and comprising a lipophilic carotenoid having a log P of greater than about 12.5 where the composition has a L* value from about 60 to about 90 and a hue value from about −50 to about 50 for at least about three (3) months when stored at about ambient temperature and further where the weight ratio of the first colorant (a) to second colorant (b) satisfies: [0000] a/b =about 0.004 to about 1,000. [0012] In a second aspect, the present invention is directed to a consumer grade colorant composition comprising: (a) a first colorant comprising dye, pigment or both; and (b) a second colorant comprising a lipophilic carotenoid having a log P of greater than about 12.5; wherein the weight ratio of first colorant (a) to second colorant (b) satisfies [0000] a/b =about 0.004 to about 1,000. [0016] In a third aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for influencing the color of skin with the first aspect of this invention. [0017] In an especially preferred aspect, the composition for influencing skin color and the colorant composition are substantially free of formaldehyde releasing preservatives. [0018] Additional aspects of the present invention will more readily become apparent from the description and examples which follow. [0019] The value L*, as used herein, means the CIELAB color coordinate for luminance or lightness. Hue is defined to mean [tan−1(b*/a*)] where a* is the CIELAB color coordinate for red/green and b* is the yellow/blue color coordinate. Substantially free of means less than about 0.015%, and preferably, zero to less than about 0.01% by weight, based on total weight of the composition for influencing skin color or consumer grade colorant composition. [0020] Formaldehyde releasing preservative is meant to mean a preservative suitable to generate H 2 CO when in an end use composition. Such preservatives include, for example, quarternium-15, imidozolidinyl urea, diazolidinyl urea, DMDM hydantoin, bromonitropropane diol or the like. [0021] Skin, as used herein, is meant to mean skin on the face and body. The composition of this invention can be a base or sold as an end use composition. Such a composition may be sold in any consumable acceptable form such as a bar, liquid, stick, roll-on formulation, cream, fabric applied formulation, mousse, lotion, ointment cosmetic, or foundation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0022] The only limitations with respect to the dye and/or pigment that may be used in this invention is that the same is/are safe for topical application, compatible with a lipophilic carotenoid and suitable to be used to generate a composition with the color characteristics as defined herein. Such dyes and/or pigments are preferably those that are allowed in all cosmetic compositions, including those that may come in contact with lips.

In a preferred embodiment, the first colorant is a red (azo) dye (Food Red 1) sold under the name Ponceau Sx (CAS 4548-53-2), made commercially available from suppliers like Sensient Technologies, Spectrum Chemicals &amp; Laboratory Products as well as Alfa Chem. [0024] The second colorant suitable for use herein is limited only to the extent that the same may be used in a cosmetic composition and is a lipophilic carotenoid (i.e., coloring antioxidant) having a log P of greater than about 12.5. Illustrative non-limiting examples of the types of carotenoids suitable for use in this invention include beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, astaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, mixtures thereof or the like. In a preferred embodiment, however, the carotenoid used herein is lycopene which is available from suppliers like DSM Nutritional Products and Parry Nutraceuticals. [0025] Often, the weight ratio of first colorant:second colorant equals 0.004 to about 1,000. Preferably, the weight ratio of first colorant:second colorant is from about 1:6 to about 6:1, and most preferably, from about 1:3 to about 3:1, including all ratios subsumed therein. In an especially preferred embodiment, the total colorant (first and second colorant) used in this invention is less than about 0.4%, and preferably, less than about 0.25%, and most preferably, less than a bout 0.1%, based on total weight of the topical composition. [0026] Optional additives may be added to the topical composition of the present invention in order to yield a desired end use composition. For example, such an end use topical composition may optionally contain a skin conditioning agent. These agents may be selected from humectants, exfoliants or emollients. [0027] Humectants are polyhydric alcohols intended for moisturizing, reducing, scaling and stimulating removal of built-up scale from the skin. Typical polyhydric alcohols include polyalkylene glycols and more preferably alkylene polyols and their derivatives. Illustrative are propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, glycerin, hydroxypropyl sorbitol, hexylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, ethoxylated glycerin, propoxylated glycerin and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the humectant is glycerin. Amounts of humectant may range (if used) anywhere from about 0.01 to 15%, preferably from about 0.01 to about 10%, optimally from about 0.75 to about 5% by weight. [0028] Exfoliants suitable for use in the topical compositions of the present invention may be selected from alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids, beta-hydroxycarboxylic acids and salts of these acids. Often, the exfoliants, when employed, make up from about 0.1 to about 6% by weight of the topical composition. [0029] Most preferred are glycolic, lactic and salicylic acids and their ammonium salts. [0030] A wide variety of C 2 -C 30 alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids may be employed. Suitable examples include: α-hydroxyethanoic acid α-hydroxypropanoic acid α-hydroxyhexanoic acid α-hydroxyoctanoic acid α-hydroxydecanoic acid α-hydroxydodecanoic acid α-hydroxytetradecanoic acid α-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid α-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid α-hydroxyeicosanoic acid α-hydroxydocosanoic acid α-hydroxyhexacosanoic acid, and α-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid. [0044] When the conditioning agent is an emollient it may be selected from hydrocarbons, fatty acids, fatty alcohols and esters, whereby the emollients (when used) typically make from about 0.1 to about 25% by weight of the total weight of the topical composition. Petrolatum is the most preferred hydrocarbon type of emollient conditioning agent. Other hydrocarbons that may be employed include mineral oil, polyolefins such as polydecene, and parafins such as isohexadecane (e.g. Permethyl 99® and Permethyl 101®). [0045] Fatty acids and alcohols (as emollients) suitable for use often have from 10 to 30 carbon atoms. Illustrative of this category are pelargonic, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, isostearic, hydroxystearic, oleic, linoleic, ricinoleic, arachidic, behenic and erucic acids and alcohols. [0046] Oily ester emollients suitable for use in the topical compositions made according to this invention can be those selected from one or more of the following classes: 1. Triglyceride esters such as vegetable and animal fats and oils. Examples include castor oil, cocoa butter, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, olive oil, cod liver oil, almond oil, avocado oil, palm oil, sesame oil, squalene, Kikui oil and soybean oil. 2.

Wax esters such as beeswax, spermaceti, myristyl myristate, stearyl stearate. [0055] The topical compositions of the present invention should contain substantial levels of water. Such compositions often contain water in amounts ranging from 50 to 900%, preferably from 55 to 85% by weight, whereby the topical compositions of this invention can comprise water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions. [0056] Other emollients which may be used are generally classified as siloxanes or silicon derivatives. Illustrative non-limiting examples include materials like dimethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, cross-linked siloxane based polymers and mixtures thereof. [0057] Surfactants can be a further optional additive of the topical compositions made according to the present invention. These may be selected from nonionic, anionic, cationic or emulsifying agents. They may range, when used, in amount anywhere from about 0.1 to about 25% by weight. Illustrative nonionic surfactants are alkoxylated compounds based on C 10 -C 22 fatty alcohols and acids, and sorbitan. These materials are available, for instance, from the Shell Chemical Company under the Neodol trademark. Copolymers of polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene, sold by the BASF Corporation under the Pluronic trademark, are sometimes also useful. Alkyl polyglycosides available from the Henkel Corporation may also be utilized for purposes of this invention. [0058] Anionic type surfactants include fatty acid soaps, sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium lauryl ether sulphate, alkyl benzene sulphonate, mono- and di-alkyl acid phosphates and sodium fatty acyl isethionate. [0059] Amphoteric surfactants include such materials as dialkylamine oxide and various types of betaines (such as cocoamidopropyl betaine). [0060] Still other optional additives suitable for use in the topical compositions of this invention include thickeners. Such thickeners are often generally classified as carboxylic acid polymers, cross-linked polyacrylate polymers, polyacrylamide polymers or the like. Typical thickeners include cross linked acrylates (e.g. Carbopol 982 or Carbopol Ultrex 10), hydrophobically-modified acrylates (e.g. Carbopol 1382), cellulosic derivatives and natural gums. Among useful cellulosic derivatives are sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, polyacrylamide comprising thickeners (like Sepigel™305) and hydroxymethyl cellulose. Gums suitable for the present invention include guar, xanthan, magnesium aluminum silicate (Veegum), sclerotium, carrageenan, pectin and combinations of these gums. Amounts of the thickener may range from 0.0001 to 5%, usually from 0.001 to 1%, optimally from 0.01 to 0.5% by weight, based on total weight of the topical composition and including all ranges subsumed therein. [0061] Typically, the optional additives used in the topical composition of this invention, collectively, make up less than about 30%, and preferably, less than about 15%, and most preferably less than about 10% by weight of the topical composition, based on total weight of the topical composition and including all ranges subsumed therein. [0062] Optional, but especially preferred additives which may be used in the topical composition of this invention include sunscreen or ultra violet light blocking materials. Illustrative compounds are PABA, and derivatives of cinnamic and salicylic acid. For example, octyl methoxycinnamate and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (also known as oxybenzone) can also be used. Octyl methoxycinnamate, 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate (Parsol MCX®), and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone are all commercially available. Others which may be used include octocrylene, butylmethoxydibenzoyl methane (Parsol 1789®) and phenylbezimidazole sulfonic acid. The preferred ultraviolet light blockers are Parsol 1789® and Parsol MCX®, and especially, a mixture of the same at a weight ratio from about 1:6 to about 6:1, and preferably, from about 1:5 to about 5:1, and most preferably, from about 1:4 to about 4:1, including all ranges subsumed therein. Typically, the amount of ultraviolet light blocker used in this invention, when desired, is from about 0.5 to about 10%, and preferably, from about 0.75 to about 6%, and most preferably, from about 1 to about 5% by weight, based on total weight of the topical composition and including all ranges subsumed therein. [0063] Even other optional but especially preferred additives that may be used with the topical composition of this invention include physical scatterers (like TiO 2 and/or ZnO), skin lighteners like niacinamide, coumarin derived compounds 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, 3-propionylbenzothiazol-2-one, mixtures thereof or the like, skin care chelators (like EDTA), benefit agents like a linoleic acid, retinol and derivatives thereof or mixtures thereof, other antioxidants, like, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and derivatives thereof (like sodium ascorbyl phosphate and tocopherol acetate), mixtures thereof or the like. When used, these other especially preferred optional additives, collectively, make up from about 0.01 to about 12%, and preferably, from about 0.1 to about 7% by weight of the topical composition, based on total weight of the topical composition and including all ranges subsumed therein. [0064] Preservatives can desirably be incorporated into the compositions of this invention to protect against the growth of potentially harmful microorganisms, and therefore, are yet another class of optional but especially preferred additives. While it is in the aqueous phase that microorganisms tend to grow, microorganisms can also reside in the oil phase. As such, preservatives which have solubility in both water and oil are preferably employed in the present compositions. Suitable traditional preservatives are alkyl esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid. Particularly preferred preservatives for use in this invention are methyl paraben, propyl paraben, sodium dehydroxyacetate, phenoxyethanol and benzyl alcohol. Preservatives are preferably employed in amounts ranging from 0.01% to 3% by weight of the topical composition. In an especially preferred embodiment, the preservative employed is methyl paraben, propyl paraben or a mixture thereof, and the weight ratio of preservative to ultraviolet light blocker employed is from about 1:8 to about 8:1, and preferably, from about 1:6 to about 6:1, and most preferably, from about 1:4 to about 4:1, including all ratios subsumed therein.'.\n",

Illustrative nonionic surfactants are alkoxylated compounds based on C 10 -C 22 fatty alcohols and acids, and sorbitan. These materials are available, for instance, from the Shell Chemical Company under the Neodol trademark. Copolymers of polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene, sold by the BASF Corporation under the Pluronic trademark, are sometimes also useful. Alkyl polyglycosides available from the Henkel Corporation may also be utilized for purposes of this invention.

[0059] Amphoteric surfactants include such materials as dialkylamine oxide and various types of betaines (such as cocoamidopropyl betaine). [0060] Still other optional additives suitable for use in the topical compositions of this invention include thickeners. Such thickeners are often generally classified as carboxylic acid polymers, cross-linked polyacrylate polymers, polyacrylamide polymers or the like. Typical thickeners include cross linked acrylates (e.g. Carbopol 982 or Carbopol Ultrex 10), hydrophobically-modified acrylates (e.g. Carbopol 1382), cellulosic derivatives and natural gums. Among useful cellulosic derivatives are sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, polyacrylamide comprising thickeners (like Sepigel™305) and hydroxymethyl cellulose.

[0061] Typically, the optional additives used in the topical composition of this invention, collectively, make up less than about 30%, and preferably, less than about 15%, and most preferably less than about 10% by weight of the topical composition, based on total weight of the topical composition and including all ranges subsumed therein. [0062] Optional, but especially preferred additives which may be used in the topical composition of this invention include sunscreen or ultra violet light blocking materials. Illustrative compounds are PABA, and derivatives of cinnamic and salicylic acid. For example, octyl methoxycinnamate and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (also known as oxybenzone) can also be used. Octyl methoxycinnamate, 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate (Parsol MCX®), and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone are all commercially available.

The preferred ultraviolet light blockers are Parsol 1789® and Parsol MCX®, and especially, a mixture of the same at a weight ratio from about 1:6 to about 6:1, and preferably, from about 1:5 to about 5:1, and most preferably, from about 1:4 to about 4:1, including all ranges subsumed therein. Typically, the amount of ultraviolet light blocker used in this invention, when desired, is from about 0.5 to about 10%, and preferably, from about 0.75 to about 6%, and most preferably, from about 1 to about 5% by weight, based on total weight of the topical composition and including all ranges subsumed therein.

      "Changed 'means' by 'time' in 'PRIORITY CLAIMS This application is a Continuation of International Application No. PCT/CH00/00390, filed on Jul. 18, 2000, which claims priority to German Application No. DE 199 39 023 A1, filed on Aug. 18, 1999, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field The invention relates to a device for administering an injectable product. 2. Description of the Related Art Injection devices, for example injection syringes or injection pens, such as the invention relates to in particular though not exclusively, conventionally comprise a casing which accommodates an ampoule with the product to be injected, a delivering means for delivering the product out of the ampoule and a coupling means. The delivering means is conventionally formed by a piston which is movable in the ampoule. In simple syringes, the muscular power of the user serves as the drive means. The use of spring elements, in particular pressure springs, as the drive means is also known. The coupling means forms a transmission link or drive connection from the drive means to the delivering means. The known drive means, for example drive springs, have the disadvantage that the drive force or drive energy applied by them is subject to changes in the course of being released. In drive springs, the drive energy changes in accordance with the spring characteristic. The delivering rate of the delivering means follows such changes. Correspondingly, the delivery rate changes in the course of delivery in accordance with the changing drive energy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide a device for administering an injectable product, with which the product is evenly delivered in the course of an injection or infusion. The invention is based on a device for administering an injectable product which includes a casing, a container for the product accommodated by the casing, a delivering means, a drive means and a transmission link or coupling means. The product is delivered directly out of the container by the delivering means. The drive means supplies the drive energy required for this, said drive energy being transmitted in the transmission link to the delivering means, in such a way that the delivering means is driven by the drive means, to deliver the product. The container, the delivering means, the drive means and the transmission members of the transmission link are preferably arranged in the casing. Other arrangements are, however, in principle equally possible. The injectable product is preferably a medical or cosmetic agent, in particular in the form of a liquid active solution. A prominent example is insulin, administered using the device within the context of a treatment for diabetes. The device is preferably an infusion device. It can, however, also be an injection device. The container can, in particular, be formed as an ampoule, as is the case in known infusion devices. The delivering means is preferably formed by a piston accommodated by the container, which is advanced towards an outlet of the container, to deliver the product. However, instead of such a piston, the delivering means can in principle be formed by any type of pump suitable for delivering the product. According to its type, the drive means is preferably formed in such a way that it releases the energy stored in it when it is triggered. Via a coupling means, this released energy is transmitted in the transmission link to the delivering means which, driven for its part in this way, delivers the product out of the container. The drive means is preferably formed by a drive spring, particularly preferably a pressure spring. In principle, however, other designs of drive means may also be used, e.g. those which release a pressure gas when triggered. According to the invention, a fluid space for an incompressible fluid and a pressure reducing means are provided in the transmission link from the drive means to the delivering means, i.e. in the coupling means. The fluid space correspondingly comprises a drive side, upon which the drive means acts, and a driven side, which acts on the delivering means. Both the drive side and the driven side can be connected, directly or via other transmission members, to the drive means and/or delivering means respectively. The fluid space can be impinged on its drive side by pressure from the drive means. The pressure thus generated is reduced toward the driven side of the fluid space by the pressure reducing means. The pressure is preferably reduced to a fifth or less and particularly preferably to a tenth or less by means of the pressure reducing means. The pressure reducing means creates a fluid connection which only allows a delayed flow of the fluid from the drive side towards the driven side, such that in a dynamic state, i.e. while the delivering means is being driven, a greater fluid pressure prevails on the drive side than on the driven side. The invention enables a drive means to be used in which substantially more energy is stored than would be required to drive the delivering means and the resulting delivery of the product. The comparatively large drive energy released when the drive means is triggered is attenuated by the fluid coupling in accordance with the invention onto the measure required for delivering and administering. The excess of drive energy is available, controlled due to the fluid coupling in accordance with the invention, for driving the delivering means. If a drive spring is used as the drive means, as is preferred, then the spring strength of this drive means can be significantly higher than in the case of a direct drive connection to the delivering means. In particular, such a drive spring can be operated in a smaller range of its spring characteristic than would be possible in the case of a direct coupling. Particularly preferably, a working stroke of the drive means is transmitted into a working stroke of the delivering means by the fluid coupling, said working stroke of the delivering means being greater than the working stroke of the drive means. In the case of a pressure or tension spring as the drive means and a piston as the delivering means, the respective working stroke is the stretching or straining of the spring and the distance covered by the piston in dependence on this working stroke. Particularly preferably, the delivering means is formed as a piston and the drive means likewise acts on a piston, designated in the following as a drive piston. In this embodiment, the drive side of the fluid space is formed by a piston area of the drive piston. The piston area of the drive piston is preferably larger than a piston area of a driven piston, wherein the piston area of the driven piston forms the driven side of the fluid space. Through this ratio of the two piston areas, a stroke of the drive piston is transmitted into a comparatively larger stroke of the driven piston. Expressed differently, a smaller stroke of the drive piston is required to achieve a given stroke of the driven piston. The working stroke of the drive piston can be kept correspondingly short. The drive means can be operated in a tight range around its optimal operating point. Furthermore, the different-sized piston areas lead to a reduction of force. The force exerted by the drive piston is reduced in accordance with the ratio of the areas of the drive piston and driven piston. This reduction occurs in addition to the reduction of force as a result of the reduction of pressure. The Applicant reserves the right to independently further prosecute the feature of the different-sized piston areas, together with features a) to e) of claim 1. The driven piston can form the delivering means directly. The driven piston is, however, preferably another piston. In a particularly preferred example embodiment, the fluid space is sub-divided into a first partial space including the drive side and a second partial space including the driven side, and the two partial spaces are connected to each other exclusively by a system of capillaries, if a higher pressure prevails on the drive side than on the driven side of the fluid space. The system of capillaries can be formed by a single capillary or also by a plurality of capillaries. The capillary or plurality of capillaries is/are advantageously as long as possible. Its/their length is preferably at least 0.5 m. If a plurality of capillaries are formed, this preferably applies to each of the capillaries. The through-flow rate in long capillaries is less dependent on the diameter of the capillary, as directly follows from the Hagen-Poiseuille Law. According to the Hagen-Poiseuille Law, variations in the diameter due to imprecision in production enter into the through-flow rate in the fourth power. However, with an increasing length of the capillary, its diameter can likewise be enlarged, if the through-flow rate is to remain constant. Larger diameters are on the one hand by their very nature simpler to produce than smaller diameters, and with an increasing size of the diameter, deviations from the desired diameter arise to an increasingly less important extent only. Furthermore, an as high viscosity of the working fluid as possible in the fluid space is preferred. The system of capillaries preferably comprises a capillary running spirally, or a plurality of such capillaries. In a preferred example embodiment, the system of capillaries is formed by a single, spiral capillary. A spiral capillary not only has the advantage of a large length, but can also be simply produced. In particular, it can be formed in the form of an external or internal thread on a corresponding surface area, preferably a shell or jacket surface area, of a capillary body. The capillary body with the external or internal thread is preferably placed into or onto another body with a smooth opposite surface area, wherein care must be taken that the threads of the capillary body are sealed against each other on the opposite surface area. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention will now be described by way of a preferred example embodiment. There is shown: FIG. 1 an infusion device in a longitudinal section; FIG. 2 a capillary in accordance with Detail I of FIG. 1; and FIG. 3 an alternative embodiment of a capillary. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 shows a longitudinal section of an infusion device. A circular cylindrical outer sleeve 3 , together with a sealing piece 9 at a proximal end and a sealing cap 19 at a distal end, forms a casing of the infusion device. A container holder 4 a is held centered in a proximal region of the outer sleeve 3. A container 1 in the form of an ampoule is accommodated by the container holder 4 a , likewise centered with respect to the central longitudinal axis of the outer sleeve 3. The container 1 is filled with a product to be injected, for example insulin. A delivering means 2 in the form of a delivering piston is furthermore movably accommodated by the container, in a straight line toward an outlet of the container 1. A catheter 20 is connected to the outlet of the container 1 in a manner known in its own right. An inner sleeve 4 b is arranged in a distal region of the infusion device, concentric with respect to the outer sleeve 3. In the example embodiment, the container holder 4 a and the inner sleeve 4 b are formed as a one-piece sleeve. The container holder 4 a and the inner sleeve 4 b could also be separate components. However, forming them as one piece simplifies holding them commonly centered in the outer sleeve 3 , as can be directly inferred from FIG. 1 and the subsequent description. An inner surface area of the inner sleeve 4 b forms a slide bearing for a driven piston 6 accommodated by the inner sleeve 4 b , said driven piston being connected rigidly to the delivering piston 2 by means of a piston rod 7. The driven piston 6 and the piston rod 7 are formed as one piece. The piston rod 7 abuts the delivering piston 2. It could also be firmly connected to the delivering piston 2 ; for example, it could be screwed to the delivering piston 2. Furthermore, the piston rod 7 can equally be guided into a collar region between the container holder 4 a and the inner sleeve 4 b , for example guided fluid-proof. The driven piston 6 seals toward the inner sleeve 4 b using sealing rings 17 in the manner of piston rings. A ring space is formed between the outer sleeve 3 and the inner sleeve 4 b , a drive piston 5 being arranged in said ring space. The drive piston 5 is a ring piston which is slid back and forth, fluid-proof and tight, between the outer sleeve 3 and the inner sleeve 4 b. Sealing rings 15 are accommodated by grooves in an inner surface area of the drive piston 5 and other sealing rings 16 are accommodated by grooves on an outer surface area of the drive piston 5 , each in the manner of piston rings. The drive piston 5 comprises a plane ring area on a distal front face. The drive piston 5 tapers toward the inner sleeve 4 b in the proximal direction. The taper is formed by means of a collar. An opposite area of the infusion device lies opposite the collar, seen in the proximal direction. The opposite area is formed by a distance piece in the form of a distance ring 9 a , which surrounds the container holder 4 a and lies loose on the sealing piece 9. In a ring space between the outer sleeve 3 on the one hand and the container holder 4 a and the inner sleeve 4 b on the other, a pressure spring 8 is accommodated between the two opposing areas, i.e. the collar of the drive piston 5 and the distance ring 9 a , abutting the two areas. By varying the strength of the distance ring 9 a , i.e. by exchanging it, the device can be simply adapted to different pressure springs 8 , to continuously set the operative range of the spring optimally. A capillary body 10 is arranged behind the drive piston 5 in the distal direction. The capillary body 10 comprises a proximal ring region and is occluded by a base at its distal end. In the region of its ring body, the capillary body 10 is sealed fluid-proof against the outer sleeve 3 and preferably also against the inner sleeve 4 b. A distal front area of the inner sleeve 4 b pushes fluid-proof against the base of the capillary body 10 via a sealing ring 18. The capillary body 10 is provided with a aperture opening 14 in the region of a distal opening on the front face of the inner sleeve 4 b which is sealed by the sealing ring 18. An aperture open in one direction only is formed in the capillary body 10 by a reflux valve. The reflux valve comprises a valve ball 11 which is pressed into its fitting within the capillary body 10 in a known way by means of a valve spring 12. The valve spring 12 is in turn supported on a valve closure 13. A fluid space is formed between the distal front area of the drive piston 5 and a distal front area of the driven piston 6 , said fluid space being occluded fluid-proof by said two pistons 5 and 6 and comprising a first partial space 21 and a second partial space 22. The two partial spaces 21 and 22 are separated from each other by the capillary body 10. The fluid space 21 , 22 is completely filled with an incompressible working fluid. A highly viscous oil is preferably used as the working fluid. The reflux valve 11 , 12 , 13 only allows a through-flow of the working fluid from the partial space 22 into the partial space 21 , and prevents a through-flow in the other direction. The capillary body 10 , together with an inner surface area of the outer sleeve 3 surrounding the capillary body, forms a fluid connection in the form of a system of capillaries. The system of capillaries is shown in Detail I of FIG. 2. It is formed by a single, connected fluid channel, namely a capillary 23. The capillary 23 , in the form of a multiple thread, encircles the outer surface area of the capillary body 10 in a spiral. In principle, the capillary 23 can also be formed by a single thread. When the capillary body 10 is installed, the capillary 23 connects the two partial fluid spaces 21 and 22. The inner surface area of the outer sleeve 3 opposite the capillary 23 is simply smooth. The capillary body 10 is guided into the outer sleeve 3 by a slight pressing power. When installed, the “teeth” on the outer surface area of the capillary body 10 , which separate the individual threads of the capillary 23 from each other, press fluid-proof against the inner surface area of the outer sleeve 3. The teeth of the capillary body 10 are flattened for sealing purposes. The capillary body 10 consists of a softer material than the outer sleeve 3 , in order to improve sealing. For the same purpose, however, the outer sleeve 3 could also in principle be made of a softer material than the capillary body 10. An alternative embodiment of a capillary 23 is shown in FIG. 3. In this case, the capillary 23 is formed in one insert as a straight fluid channel. The insert is held fluid-proof in a receptacle of the capillary body.'.\n",

      "Changed 'measurement' by 'composition' in 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an eye refractive power measurement apparatus which objectively measures a refractive power of an eye to be examined. 2. Description of Related Art It is conventionally known an eye refractive power measurement apparatus which projects a target for measurement onto a fundus of an eye to be examined and objectively measures a refractive power of the eye based on the reflected light therefrom. When precisely measuring a refractive power of the eye using this kind of apparatus, the measurement is carried out usually by relaxing accommodation of the eye by a fogging mechanism and the measurement is repeated a plurality of times. Statistical processes are given to the measurement results obtained thereby such as letting the median or the average be the typical value of the all data values indicating the eye refractive power. The value obtained through the statistical processes is utilized as an initial value in a subjective measurement to be performed next. However, when measuring an eye which has low hyperopia, an examinee looks into the apparatus and thus so-called instrumental myopia is often caused. As a result, the accommodation of the eye is likely to be unstable. Owing to the unstableness of the accommodation, it may be the case where all the measurement results indicate a negative (or minus) spherical power, or only one result out of three indicates a positive (or plus) spherical power. Upon these cases, if decided in the aforementioned way, the typical value will be of a negative power. Judging from this typical value, an examiner may diagnose that the eye as myopia. If a subjective refractive power measurement is started from a negative spherical power, with a continues accommodation, it is extremely difficult to obtain corrective spherical value for the hyperopic eye by relaxing the accommodation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and has an object to overcome the above problems and to provide an eye refractive power measurement apparatus capable of providing a measurement result which secures accuracy in a subjective refractive power measurement to be performed next even in cases measuring an eye which possibly has low hyperopia. Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. To achieve the objects and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, an eye refractive power measurement apparatus including measurement means for objectively measuring a refractive power of an eye to be examined, the apparatus comprises memory means for storing a plurality of measurement results obtained by the measurement means, typical value determination means for determining a typical value of the measurement results based on the plurality of the measurement results stored in the memory means, judging means for judging whether or not the eye possibly has low hyperopia based on the plurality of the measurement results stored in the memory means, recommendation value determination means for determining a recommendation value which is different from the typical value if the judging means judges that the eye possibly has low hyperopia and data output means for outputting data indicating the typical value and/or the recommendation value. In another aspect of the present invention, an eye refractive power measurement apparatus including measurement means for objectively measuring a refractive power of an eye to be examined, the apparatus comprises memory means for storing a plurality of measurement results obtained by the measurement means, typical value determination means for determining a typical value of the measurement results by giving a predetermined statistical process to the plurality of the measurement results stored in the memory means, judging means for judging that the eye possibly has low hyperopia if both positive and negative spherical powers are included in the plurality of measurement results stored in the memory means, all of the measurement results includes 0 diopter spherical power, both 0 diopter and negative spherical powers are included in the plurality of the measurement results, or all of the measurement results includes negative spherical powers and are greater than a predetermined negative spherical power, recommendation value determination means for determining a recommendation value which is different from the typical value by giving a predetermined process if the judging means judges that the eye possibly has low hyperopia and data output means for outputting data indicating the typical value and/or the recommendation value. In another aspect of the present invention, an eye refractive power measurement apparatus for measuring a refractive power of an eye to be examined, the apparatus comprises objective measurement means for objectively measuring the refractive power of the eye, memory means for storing a plurality of measurement results obtained by the objective measurement means, typical value determination means for determining a typical value of the measurement results based on the plurality of the measurement results stored in the memory means, judging means for judging whether or not the eye possibly has low hyperopia based on the plurality of the measurement results stored in the memory means, recommendation value determination means for determining a recommendation value which is different from the typical value if the judging means judges that the eye possibly has low hyperopia, subjective measurement means for subjectively measuring a refractive power of the eye and subjective measurement control means for controlling the subjective measurement means based on data indicating the typical value and/or the recommendation value. According to the present invention, even in cases of measuring an eye which possibly has low hyperopia, the apparatus is capable of providing measurement data which helps a subjective refractive power measurement which is performed next to be accurate.

The subjective refractive power measurement apparatus 66 is the type of apparatus which is provided with a lens unit 66a; the lens unit 66a which is composed of a pair of right and left parts places one optical element among various kinds of optical elements alternatively at a test window by electric power. 66b is a controller for the lens unit 66a. In a measurement carried out by the subjective refractive power measurement apparatus 66, a test chart is presented through the corrective optical system provided at the test window. A refractive power of the eye E will be subjectively measured based on responses from the examinee. Operations of the apparatus having above-described configuration will be explained hereinafter. First, the eye E is to be fixed at a predetermined position with use of the face support unit 2. As observing an image of the anterior part of the eye E displayed on the TV monitor 7, alignments are made by operating the joystick 5 and the rotation knob 5a so as to bring a reticle mark generated in the display circuit 51 and an image of the target for alignment formed by the target projecting optical system 40 into predetermined positions in relation to each other. When the alignment is completed, measurement is to be started at a push of the measurement starting switch 6. The measurement light emitted from the light sources 11 successively passes through the condenser lens 12, the target plate 13, the beam splitter 42, the projecting lens 14 and the beam splitter 15, then converges in the vicinity of the cornea of the eye E. Thereafter, the measurement light arrives upon the fundus of the eye E thereby projects a target for measurement by the target plate 13 thereon. In case of an emmetropic eye, an image of the target for measurement reflected from the fundus of the eye E is reflected by the beam splitter 15, passes though the object lens 17, reflected again by the beam splitter 16, passes through the relay lense 18, the relay lense 19 and then the image forming lens 22 thereby form an image on the photo-detector 23. If the eye E has a refractive error, the motor 58 is driven so as to move the target plate 13 along with the movable lens 21 to a conjugate position with the fundus of the eye E in accordance with a receive signal responsive to reflected light from the fundus received by the photo-detector 23. Next, the first relay lens 32 is moved so as to place the fixation target 34 and the fundus of the eye E at conjugate positions with each other, and further moves the first relay lens 32 so that the adequate amount of diopter is to be fogged. With the eye E being fogged, the light sources 11, the corneal reflection eliminating mask 20 and the photo-detector 23 are made to be rotated 180° about the optical axis. During the rotation, the target plate 13 and the movable lens 21 move in response to the signal from the photo-detector 23. The potentiometer 60 detects the amount of the movement and thereby obtains a value of a refractive power in each meridian direction. The controller 50 gives a predetermined process to the obtained refractive power so as to obtain values of S (spherical power), C (cylindrical power) and A (cylindrical axial angle). For this measurement method of an eye refractive power, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,697 corresponding to Japanese Patent Publication of unexamined patent application No. HEI 7-39517 by the present applicant. Such measurement as described above is repeated a plurality of times on one and the same eye to be examined. The measurement may be repeated by depressing the measurement starting switch 6 a plurality of times or by programming to do so automatically in response to one trigger signal (measurement starting signal). The controller 50 stores the data obtained from the repeated measurements into the memory 62 and gives a predetermined statistical process to the data so as to obtain its typical value. This is to select an initial corrective optical system in accordance with the typical value for a subjective refractive power measurement which is to be performed next, which allows even an unskilled examiner in optometry to easily decide an accurate initial value for the corrective optical system. The typical value may be decided, for example, by ranking the obtained values in order of their sizes to make the median be the typical value (or the average value of all the obtained data can be the typical value). As well as calculating the typical value, the controller 50 judges whether or not the eye possibly has low hyperopia. In cases where it is judged that the eye possibly has low hyperopia, the controller 50 calculates a desirable value (hereinafter mentioned as a recommendation value) which is a suitable value to be used as an initial value in the subjective refractive power measurement. It is judged that the eye possibly has low hyperopia in cases where (a) both positive and negative spherical powers are included in the obtained values of S, (b) all the values of S are equal to 0D [Diopter], both 0D and negative spherical powers are included in the obtained values of S, or all the values of S are negative spherical powers and weaker than a predetermined standard value (for example, -1.00 D or greater). When it is judged that the eye possibly has low hyperopia, the recommendation value is decided in the following way. In the cases of (a), the greatest value of S among all the measurement data is picked out to be the recommendation value. It is also possible to determine the recommendation value by adding a predetermined value to the average or the median of the obtained data from which data of S having negative degrees is excluded.'.\n",

      "Changed 'measurement' by 'portion' in 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an eye refractive power measurement apparatus which objectively measures a refractive power of an eye to be examined. 2. Description of Related Art It is conventionally known an eye refractive power measurement apparatus which projects a target for measurement onto a fundus of an eye to be examined and objectively measures a refractive power of the eye based on the reflected light therefrom. When precisely measuring a refractive power of the eye using this kind of apparatus, the measurement is carried out usually by relaxing accommodation of the eye by a fogging mechanism and the measurement is repeated a plurality of times. Statistical processes are given to the measurement results obtained thereby such as letting the median or the average be the typical value of the all data values indicating the eye refractive power. The value obtained through the statistical processes is utilized as an initial value in a subjective measurement to be performed next. However, when measuring an eye which has low hyperopia, an examinee looks into the apparatus and thus so-called instrumental myopia is often caused. As a result, the accommodation of the eye is likely to be unstable. Owing to the unstableness of the accommodation, it may be the case where all the measurement results indicate a negative (or minus) spherical power, or only one result out of three indicates a positive (or plus) spherical power. Upon these cases, if decided in the aforementioned way, the typical value will be of a negative power. Judging from this typical value, an examiner may diagnose that the eye as myopia. If a subjective refractive power measurement is started from a negative spherical power, with a continues accommodation, it is extremely difficult to obtain corrective spherical value for the hyperopic eye by relaxing the accommodation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and has an object to overcome the above problems and to provide an eye refractive power measurement apparatus capable of providing a measurement result which secures accuracy in a subjective refractive power measurement to be performed next even in cases measuring an eye which possibly has low hyperopia.

      "Changed 'light' by 'component' in 'CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of the co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/351,769 filed Feb. 10, 2006, which application is incorporated by reference in its entirety and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/652,450 filed on Feb. 11, 2005, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety, and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/702,185 filed on Jul. 25, 2005, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to a handheld light emitting device; more particularly, to a handheld flashlight combined with a retractable leash. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] A typical handheld flashlight includes a substantially cylindrical handle that is gripped by a user&#39;s hand. The flashlight has a single light emitting source at one end that receives power from a dry cell battery or a series of dry cell batteries that are positioned within the handle. [0004] While a standard flashlight has many useful purposes, it is difficult to grip the handle on a flashlight for long periods of time because the user&#39;s grip fatigues due to the unnatural position of the user&#39;s hand about the flashlight handle. Also, many of the handles have a narrow diameter and are difficult to grip. Further, the weight of the dry cell batteries positioned within the handle cause the user&#39;s grip to fatigue over time. [0005] Another issue that arises when using a standard flashlight in unfamiliar terrain is that the user typically prefers to have a beam shining in a forward direction for a distance to allow the user to see and avoid potential hazards. While wanting to see what is in front of the user, the user also prefers to have a beam illuminating the terrain near the user&#39;s feet so that the user does not slip, fall or trip over an unseen obstacle. While using a single beam flashlight, the user must alternate between illuminating the terrain in the distance and illuminating the ground near the user&#39;s feet. Over time this repetitive motion can become tiresome to the flashlight user. [0006] While walking a pet, typically a dog, a person may use a leash especially where there is a “leash law”. Some leashes include a retracting device including a spring biased spool upon which the leash is wound. A lever or button can be provided to control features such as automatic rewinding of the leash and holding the leash at a selected extended length. [0007] When walking a dog at night, the person typically holds a flashlight in one hand and the leash in the other hand. Therefore, the person does not have a hand available for holding other objects such as a pet waste collection bag and tool, or an umbrella for use during inclement weather. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0008] The present invention includes a light emitting apparatus having a housing with a substantially elliptical perimeter and an elongated aperture for accepting the digits of a user&#39;s hand. A first light emitting source is positioned in the housing for projecting a beam of light into a distance in front of the user. A second light emitting source is positioned in the housing for projecting a beam of light toward a surface proximate the user&#39;s feet. [0009] The housing includes a handle between the aperture and the substantially elliptical perimeter for gripping the light emitting apparatus and wherein the elliptical perimeter distributes a weight of the light emitting apparatus substantially evenly across the user&#39;s grip to prevent the user&#39;s grip from becoming fatigued. [0010] The housing encloses a spring biased reel upon which is wound a leash having one end fixed to the spool and an opposite end extending through an aperture in the housing and terminating in a hook for attaching to a pet collar. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0011] The above as well as other advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment when considered in the light of the accompanying drawings in which: [0012] FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the handheld flashlight with retractable leash according to the present invention; [0013] FIG. 2 is an elevation view of the interior of the left half of the housing shown in FIG. 1 ; [0014] FIG. 3 is an elevation view of the interior of the right half of the housing shown in FIG. 1 ; and [0015] FIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 3 with components installed. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT [0016] The U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/351,769 is hereby incorporated herein by reference. [0017] The following detailed description and appended drawings describe and illustrate various exemplary embodiments of the invention. The description and drawings serve to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any manner. In respect of the methods disclosed, the steps presented are exemplary in nature, and thus, the order of the steps is not necessary or critical. [0018] A handheld flashlight of the present invention is generally illustrated at 10 in FIG. 1. The handheld flashlight 10 has a housing 11 that is constructed of a left half 12 and a right half 13. The housing halves 12 , 13 are held together by a plurality of fasteners 14. The housing 11 has a generally elliptical shape in side elevation with substantially flat side surfaces connected by a peripheral wall 15. However, the side surfaces may have other configurations besides being substantially flat. While an elliptical shape is preferred, other configured flashlights are within the scope of the present invention including a polygonal perimeter or circular perimeter. The elliptical perimeter substantially evenly distributes the weight of the flashlight along a length which allows a user of the flashlight to grip and use the flashlight for an extended period of time without causing the user&#39;s grip to become fatigued. [0019] The left and right halves 12 , 13 are preferably constructed from a light weight plastic or polymeric material that is substantially impact resistant and able to withstand an impact when accidentally dropped. However other materials of construction are within the scope of the present invention. [0020] The left and right halves 12 , 13 have an internal aperture 16 formed therethrough that is of generally oval shape. The internal aperture 16 is shaped to accept the fingers or digits of a human hand. A top edge of the aperture 16 includes a plurality of inwardly extending portions 17 that define a gripping surface. The user positions his/her fingers into the aperture 16 while positioning a palm at the peripheral wall 15 above the portions 17. Thus, the portion of the housing 11 between the upper edge of the aperture 16 and the adjacent peripheral wall 15 defines an integral handle 18 for gripping the flashlight 10. [0021] The left and right housing halves 12 , 13 each include a front foot 11 A and a back foot 11 B extending outwardly from a bottom portion of the peripheral wall 15. The front and back feet 11 A, 11 B allow the flashlight 10 to be positioned in a selected position on a flat surface without rolling or tipping to either side. The feet 11 A, 11 B allow the user to not only use the flashlight 10 for an athletic activity such as walking, hiking or running, but also allow the flashlight 10 to be used for other activities where a stationary flashlight is required. [0022] Various components of the handheld flashlight 10 are mounted in the peripheral wall 15. A pushbutton switch 19 is positioned within an aperture formed in the wall 15 at the handle 18. The switch 19 is proximate the user&#39;s thumb when the hand is gripping the handle 18. The switch 19 is preferably a multi-positional switch for controlling a plurality of lights as discussed below. [0023] Moving in a counterclockwise direction about the housing 11 shown in FIG. 1 , an end of a lever 20 extends through an aperture formed in the peripheral wall 15. The lever 20 also is proximate the user&#39;s thumb for controlling a leash as discussed below. [0024] A first light emitting source 21 is mounted in an aperture formed in the peripheral wall 15. The light source 21 is turned on and off by the switch 19. The first light emitting source 21 is preferably a light emitting diode (LED) device having a beam that is dispersed through a lens. However, the lens is not necessary to practice the present invention. Preferably, the first light emitting source 21 is a flood light aimed forward for a distance to allow the user to see and avoid potential hazards. The LED device 21 may include one or more LEDs or light bulbs. The flood light 21 projects a broad beam of light that illuminates the ground or terrain for a substantial distance. [0025] Below the light 21 is a leash 22 extending from an aperture formed in the peripheral wall 15 and terminating in a hook 22 A for attachment to a collar worn by an animal. The leash 22 extends from and retracts into the housing 11 utilizing a spring biased reel or spool as described below. Pushing the lever 20 in a forward direction toward the light 21 locks the leash 22 in place. Pulling the lever 20 in a rearward direction frees the leash 22 for extension and retraction. [0026] The switch 19 also controls a second light emitting source 23 mounted below the leash aperture. The second light emitting source 23 is positioned to project two beams of light at a substantially 45° angle to each other between a horizontal direction of the light 21 and a vertical direction. However, other configurations of the two beams are within the scope of the present invention. The second light emitting source 23 preferably projects a narrow, high intensity beam proximate the user&#39;s feet. A cluster of more than one LED or light bulb which act together to form the narrow, intense beam can be used. Thus, the user does not have to maneuver the flashlight 10 to shine the beam of the light 21 between the user&#39;s feet and out in the distance. [0027] The switch 19 further controls a third light emitting source 24 mounted in the peripheral wall 15 opposite the light 21. The light 24 is a tail light that allows individuals approaching the user from behind to ascertain the user&#39;s position. The light 24 is useful in making the user visible whether the user is being approached by a pedestrian or a person in a vehicle. The tail light 24 is preferably a pair of red LEDs covered by a clear lens. However, a white LED can be used with a red transparent lens. The tail light 24 preferably blinks to attract attention to the light. While an LED is typical, other illuminating devices are within the scope of the present invention. Further, a transparent lens having a color other than a red lens is also within the scope of the present invention as is no lens. [0028] A multi-positionable pushbutton switch is preferred for the switch 19. A first actuation turns on the first light 21. A second actuation of the switch 19 turns on the second light 23 while the first light 21 remains on. A third actuation of the switch 19 turns on the third light 24 while the first light 21 and the second light 23 remain on. A fourth actuation of the switch 19 turns off all of the lights. Other types of switches can be used to obtain the same functionality or to control the lights in different combinations of “on” and “off” within the scope of the present invention. [0029] FIG. 1 also shows a battery cavity cover 25 positioned to close a recess or cavity (not shown) formed in the housing left half 12 for retaining a plurality of suitable batteries (not shown) that provide electrical power to the lights through the switch 19. The cover 25 is releasably retained by a pair of fasteners 26. The flashlight 10 is typically powered with three AA batteries to minimize the weight of the flashlight. However, the flashlight 10 may use one or more batteries that may be a different size than an AA battery. [0030] As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 the housing left half 12 and the housing right half 13 each include one half of the peripheral wall 15. Formed in each half of the peripheral wall 15 are the following aperture portions: pushbutton aperture 27 ; lever aperture 28 ; first light aperture 29 ; leash aperture 30 ; second light aperture 31 ; and third light aperture 32. As shown in FIG. 2 , an interior wall 33 of the battery cavity extends inwardly from the inner surface of the housing left half 12. Also formed in the side wall of the housing left half 12 are a plurality of apertures 34 for receiving the fasteners 14. The housing right half 13 has a corresponding plurality of posts 35 extending from an interior surface of the side wall for threadably receiving the fasteners 14 in bores thereby attaching the two halves of the housing 11 together. However, other fastening devices such as glue, adhesive and a snap fit are also within the scope of the present invention for retaining the halves 12 , 13 together. [0031] There is formed on the interior surface of each of the housing halves 12 , 13 a lever pivot post 36 positioned between the hand aperture 16 and the first light aperture 29. The posts 36 each have a bore formed therein for receiving an associated pin 37 ( FIG. 4 ) extending from the lever 20 to form a pivot point at a midpoint of the lever. As shown in FIG. 4 , an upper end of the lever 20 has a hollow knob 38 mounted thereon. There is a compression spring (not shown) positioned inside the knob 38 in contact with the lever 20 to bias the knob upwardly. The knob 38 has a pair of pins 39 extending from opposite sides. Each of the pins 39 slides along a bottom surface an associated rib 40 ( FIGS. 2 and 3 ) formed on the interior surface of a respective one of the housing halves 12 , 13. At the end of each rib 40 closest to the lever aperture 28 is formed a downwardly opening depression 40 A for accepting a corresponding one of the pins 39. Thus, when the knob 38 is closest to the switch aperture 27 , the user can slide the knob toward the lever aperture 28 until the spring moves the pins 39 into the depressions 40 A to hold the lever 20 when the user removes his/her thumb from the knob. [0032] The lower end of the lever 20 engages a pawl 41 as shown in FIG. 4. There is formed on the interior surface of each of the housing halves 12 , 13 a pawl pivot post 42 positioned adjacent to the leash aperture 30. The posts 42 each have a bore formed therein for receiving an associated pin 43 ( FIG. 4 ) extending from the pawl 41 to form a pivot point at one end of the pawl. Thus, pivoting of the lever 20 will produce a pivoting of the pawl 41. [0033] The first light 21 includes a reflector 44 mounted in the aperture 29 and having a cone shaped reflective surface. Mounted at an interior end of the reflector 44 is an LED assembly 45 ( FIG. 4 ) that is exposed through a central aperture in the reflector. [0034] Mounted in the leash aperture 30 is a leash guide 46 to guide the leash 22 out of and into the housing 11. The guide 46 has an arcuate opening through which the leash 22 passes. [0035] The second light aperture 31 receives a second light mount 47 upon which the two LEDs are mounted. Extending through the mount 47 is a pair of apertures 47 A ( FIG. 4 ) each receiving one of the LEDs. [0036] As shown in FIG. 4 , a reel assembly 48 for receiving the leash 22 is rotatably mounted on a tubular axle 49 extending from the inner surface of the housing right half 13. The reel assembly 48 includes an internal spirally coiled spring (not shown) as is conventional in automatically retracting electrical cord reels (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 3,450,369). As shown in FIG. 3 , the axle 49 extends through a central aperture of a flat ring shaped sound absorbing pad 50 attached to the inner surface of the housing right half 13. The pad 50 can be formed of any suitable material such as ethylene vinyl acetate (also known as EVA) which is adhesively attached to the housing. A second pad 50 is attached to the inner surface of the housing left half 12 as shown in FIG. 2. A tubular axle retainer 51 extends from the inner surface of the housing left half 12 and through a central aperture of the sound absorbing pad 50. The retainer 51 has an inner diameter greater than an outer diameter of the axle 49 and an internal wall 51 A that is received in a slot 49 A formed in the wall of the axle 49 for a positive engagement. [0037] As shown in FIG. 4 , the reel 48 has a plurality of ratchet teeth 52 formed on a side surface for cooperation with the pawl 41.'.\n",

      "Changed 'agent' by 'second' in 'FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a single drug delivery unit suitable for oral administration containing at least two distinct drug dosage packages. This multiplex system contains at least two immediate-release compartments substantially enveloped by a scored extended-release compartment. The scored nature of the extended-release *compartment facilitates the separation by the patient of the multiplex drug delivery system into individual drug dosage packages for oral administration of the prescribed dosage. Upon separation, each individual drug dosage package can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent as compared to one another and to that of the entire multiplex system. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the separability of the multiplex drug delivery system enables its use throughout the entire course of a varying dosage regimen, and thus, facilitates cost effective patient compliance. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Drug efficacy depends upon the maintenance of the proper therapeutic levels of the drug over the required treatment period. With respect to orally administered drugs, the effectiveness of treatment depends, in part or sometimes in whole, on patient compliance with the prescribed dosage regimen. Particularly where the prescribed dosage increases or decreases during the treatment period, patient compliance can suffer because of the unavailability of, or inconvenience in obtaining, the appropriate dosage of the prescribed medication at different times. It would therefore be beneficial for patients to have one drug delivery unit that allows patients themselves to regulate the amount of drug to administer. Such a capability would enable patients to use the same drug delivery unit throughout their entire treatment period even where their prescribed dosage changes during that time. Patients in such circumstances would have the convenience and cost effectiveness of obtaining in one unit and at the same time the different dosages of their prescribed drug that would be needed during their treatment period. A valuable contribution to the art therefore would be the development of a multiplex drug delivery system suitable for oral administration containing at least two immediate-release compartments substantially enveloped by a scored extended-release compartment that facilitates the separation of the multiplex drug delivery system into individual drug dosage packages for oral administration of the prescribed dosage, each of which can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent as compared to one another and to that of the entire multiplex system. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an objective of the present invention is a single drug delivery unit suitable for oral administration that patients could separate into individual drug dosage packages. These individual drug dosage packages can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent when compared to one another or when compared to the entire, intact multiplex drug delivery system. The present invention accomplishes this objective through a multiplex drug delivery system suitable for oral administration containing at least two immediate-release compartments. The scored extended-release compartment of the invention allows the separation of the multiplex drug delivery system into individual drug dosage packages for oral administration of the prescribed dosage, each of which can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent as compared to one another and to that of the entire multiplex system. One preferred embodiment of the claimed invention is a multiplex drug delivery system suitable for oral administration comprising at least two immediate-release compartments substantially enveloped by a scored extended-release compartment. The extended-release compartment can comprise a combination of a hydrophobic and a hydrophobic material. In such an embodiment, the hydrophilic polymer(s) dissolves away to weaken the extended-release compartment, while the hydrophobic material retards the water, thus helping to preserve the integrity of the drug delivery system. Where the immediate-release compartments are inert (i.e., do not comprise an active agent), they can facilitate a bursting effect, which can disrupt any remaining integrity of the extended-release compartment. In another preferred embodiment of the claimed invention, each immediate-release compartment further comprises an effective amount of an active agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and the scored extended-release compartment further comprises an effective amount of an active agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a compressed blend with the combination of a hydrophilic polymer and a hydrophobic material. In a further preferred embodiment, each immediate-release compartment further comprises an effective amount of an active agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a compressed blend with a polymer. In one other preferred embodiment, the scored extended-release compartment further comprises an effective amount of an active agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a compressed blend with the combination of a hydrophilic polymer and a hydrophobic material. By varying the composition of the polymer(s) in the immediate-release compartments and/or the relative composition of the hydrophilic polymer and hydrophobic material in the extended-release compartment, the respective time periods for the dissolution of the active agent or the bursting effect can be adjusted. In a preferred embodiment of the claimed invention, the active agent contained in the multiplex drug delivery system can be a drug. In other embodiments, that drug can be a therapeutic or a prophylactic drug. In one preferred embodiment of the claimed invention, the drug of the multiplex drug delivery system can be diltiazem, trapidil, urapidil, benziodarone, dipyridamole, isosorbide mononitrate, or lidoflazine. In another embodiment, the drug can be a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or steroidal antiinflammatory drug.

In such a preferred embodiment, the active agent of the multiplex drug delivery system can be isosorbide-5-mononitrate. In still another preferred embodiment, the active agent of the multiplex drug delivery system can exhibit the following in vitro dissolution profile when measured in a type 2 dissolution apparatus (paddle) according to U.S. Pharmacopeia XXII at 37° C.±0.5° C. in deionized water at 75 rotations per minute: from about 10% to about 75% of said active agent is released between 1 hour and 5 hours of measurement in said apparatus; and no less than about 90% of said active agent is released after 6 hours of measurement in said apparatus. In one preferred embodiment of the claimed invention, the polymer of the multiplex drug delivery system can be alginic acid, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, guar gum, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, cellulose, pregelatinized starch, sodium alginate, starch, ethylcellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polymethacrylates, povidone, shellac, or zein, and preferably hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.

Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description. The detailed description and the specific examples, however, indicate only preferred embodiments of the invention. Various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic of one preferred embodiment of the multiplex drug delivery system suitable for oral administration, which contains two immediate-release compartments substantially enveloped by a scored extended-release compartment. The scored extended-release compartment of the invention allows the separation of the multiplex drug delivery system into individual drug dosage packages for oral administration of the prescribed dosage, each of which can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent as compared to one another and to that of the entire multiplex system. In this preferred embodiment, the multiplex system consists of an oblong tablet scored in the middle to allow for easy breaking of the tablet. Each half of the tablet contains an immediate-release compartment located concentrically within the round tablet edges, allowing for a slightly thicker wall from the center edge when the tablet is broken in half. The distance between immediate-release compartments need not be greater than twice the distance between the interface of the immediate-release and extended-release compartments and that of the extended-release compartment and the outer surface or optional cosmetic compartment, so long as once separated, each individual drug dosage package can exhibit an equivalent, and preferably identical, release profile for the active agent as compared to one another and to that of the entire multiplex system.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the present invention, the term “active agent” includes one or more drugs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pro-drug forms, metabolites, and derivatives. Active agents include therapeutic or prophylactic compounds as described in the Physicians&#39; Desk Reference, most preferably including (but not limited to) those prescribed for the prevention and/or treatment of angina and hypertension: diltiazem, trapidil, urapidil, benziodarone, dipyridamole, isosorbide mononitrate, and lidoflazine; and those prescribed for the prevention and/or treatment of rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis: non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroidal antiinflanrmatory drugs such as diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diflunisal, piroxicam, motrin, and naproxen, and combinations thereof. The active agent of the present invention also preferably includes drugs that are subject to the first pass effect. Various examples of such drugs include (but are not limited to) acetaminophen, aldosterone, alprenolol, amitryptyline, aspirin, beclomethasone, diproprionate, bromocriptine, butorphanol tartrate, chlormethiazole, chlorpheniramine, chlorpromazine HCl, cimetidine, codeine, cortisone, cyclobenzamine HCl, desmethylimipramine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydroergotamine, diltiazem HCl, dobutamine HCl, domperidone, dopamine HCl, doxepin HCl, epinephrine, ergoloid mesylates, ergotamine tartrate estradiol, ethinylestradiol, flunisolide, fluorouracil, flurazepamn HCl, 5-fluoro-21-deoxyuridine, furosemide, glipizide, glyburide, glyceryl trinitrate, guanethidine sulfate, hydralazine HCl, imipramine HCl, indoramin, isoethorine HCl, isoethrine mesylate, isoprenaline, isoproterenol sulfate, isosorbide dinitrate, levallorphan tartrate, levodopa, lidocaine HCl, lignocaine, lorcainide, meperidine HCl, 6-mercaptopurine, metaproterenol sulfate, methoxamine HCl, methylphenidate, methylpreonisolone, methyltestosterone mesylate, metoclopramide, metoprolol tartrate, morphine sulfate, nalbuphine HCl, naloxone HCl, neostigmine, nifedipine, nitrendipine, nitroglycerin, norepinephrine bitartrate, norethindrone, nortriptylene HCl, oxprenolol, oxyphenbutazone, penicillamine, pentazocine HCl, pentazocine lactate, pentobarbital, petnidine, phenacetin, phentolamine HCl, phentolamine mesylate, phenylephrine HCl, phenylephrine bitartrate, phenytoin, pindolal, prazosin, prednisone, progesterone, propoxyphene HCl, propoxyphene napsylate, propranolol HCl, quinidine, reserpine, ritodrine HCl, salicylamide, salbutamol, secobarbital, testosterone, terbutaline, timolol maleate, tolbutamide, and verapamil HCl. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the active agent may include the drug, isosorbide-5-mononitrate, an organic nitrate, which is a vasodilator with effects on both arteries and veins. The empirical formula is C 6 H 9 NO 6 and the molecular weight is 191.14. The chemical name for isosorbide mononitrate is 1,4:3,6-dihydro-D-glucitrol 5-nitrate. Isosorbide mononitrate is the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate and most of the clinical activity of the dinitrate can be attributable to the mononitrate. A principal pharmacological action of isosorbide mononitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins is known to promote peripheral pooling of blood and decrease venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular and diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. The mechanism by which isosorbide mononitrate relieves angina pecteria is not fully understood. Isosorbide mononitrate is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In humans, isosorbide mononitrate is not subject to first pass metabolism in the liver. The overall elimination half-life of isosorbide mononitrate is about 6 hours. The rate of clearance is the same in healthy young adults, and in patients with various degrees of renal, hepatic, or cardiac dysfunction. In accordance with the present invention, the term “polymer” includes single or multiple polymeric substances, which can swell, gel, degrade or erode on contact with anaqueous environment (e.g., water), such as one or more of alginic acid, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, guar gum, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, cellulose, pregelatinized starch, sodium alginate, starch, ethylcellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polymethacrylates, povidone, pregelatinized starch, shellac, and zein, and combinations thereof. The “hydrophilic polymers” of the present invention include one or more of carboxymethylcellulose, guar gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, methylcellulose, and povidone. The “hydrophobic materials” of the present invention include one or more of carriauba wax, ethylcellulose, glyceryl palmitostearate, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, microcrystalline wax, polymethacrylates, and stearic acid. Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art, using the preceding description, can practice the present invention to the fullest extent. The following examples are illustrative only, and not limiting of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. EXAMPLES The method below was employed to obtain a multiplex drug delivery system, the composition of which is set forth in the tables immediately following in Table 1: Immediate-Release Compartment. Isosorbide mononitrate was first mixed with silicon dioxide in a Patterson-Kelley V-blender together with microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellulose sodium, and magnesium stearate for 15 minutes. The powder blend was then compressed using a Manesty Dry-cota with a {fraction (3/16)}″ diameter, round, flat-face punch and die set. The hardness of the tablets were maintained at 4±2kp. Immediate-Release Compartment Plus Extended-Release Compartment Isosorbide mononitrate was mixed with silicon dioxide in a Patterson-Kelley V-blender together with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2208, microcrystalline cellulose, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and magnesium stearate for 15 minutes. The core tablets were press-coated using a Korsch Core Coater {fraction (5/16)}″×¾″ capsule shape punches. The hardness of the tablets were maintained at 12±4 kp. In addition, the formulation of respective release compartments can occur by appropriate granulation methods. In wet granulation, solutions of the binding agent (polymer) are added with stirring to the mixed powders. The powder mass is wetted with the binding solution until the mass has the consistency of damp snow or brown sugar. The wet granulated material is forced through a sieving device. Moist material from the milling step is dried by.placing it in a temperature controlled container. After drying, the granulated material is reduced in particle size by passing through a sieving device. Lubricant is added, and the final blend is then compressed. In fluid-bed granulation, particles of inert material and/or active agent are suspended in a vertical column with a rising air stream. While the particles are suspended, the common granulating materials in solution are sprayed into the column. There is a gradual particle buildup under a controlled set of conditions resulting in tablet granulation. Following drying and the addition of lubricant, the granulated material is ready for compression. In dry-granulation, the active agent, diluent, and lubricant are blended and compressed into large tablets.'.\n",

No. 06/577,169 filed Feb. 6, 1984 now abandoned. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the process of permanent-waving, or &#34;perming&#34;, of hair, the overall sequence may be expressed as follows: 1. Penetration of a reducing agent into hair 2. kSSk+RSH⃡kSH+RSSk 3 kSSR+RSH⃡kSH+RSSR 4. Rearrangement of protein chains. 5. Setting the curl by reforming cystine bonds. It has been reported in the literature that under alkaline waving conditions, penetration is the slow step, with steps 2 and 3 presumably taking place as rapidly as penetration occurs. The fourth step is critical to the formation of a commercially acceptable curl. Under acid conditions, e.g., pH 5 to 7, it has been considered necessary to apply heat to achieve a proper curl. This is because step 2 is the dominant or limiting step. Under such conditions, the hair is highly susceptible to reformation of cystine bonds on rinsing through reversal of reaction 2. Under alkaline conditions, the reaction proceeds well through step 3, with increased formation of cysteine (kSH) and concomitant loss of mixed disulfide (kSSR). It is for this reason that alkaline waving solutions have been favored by the beauty industry. In conventional perming, therefore, the hair is contacted, after washing, with a waving solution of a reducing agent, normally a mercaptan, present in sufficient strength to cleave the cystine (disulfide) bond. Cleavage softens the protein structure (keratin) of the hair. Contact time depends on pH, the process used, and temperatures employed, which may be up to about 60° C. Wetting agents or other penetrants are normally employed to aid reduction. In practice, the key objective is to complete the waving process in less than one hour, with the safety and comfort of the client foremost in mind. Hair that has been chemically pretreated may be contacted with weaker solutions and for a lesser time than normal hair. Solutions of high reductant concentration may be required for hair difficult to treat, or to shorten process time. The operator normally determines whether there has been adequate processing of the hair, or that maximum bond breakage has occurred, by formation of a test curl. This determination involves unrolling the mandrel a couple of curls to ascertain if a &#34;soft S&#34; at the diameter of the mandrel pattern has formed. This is a subjective but skilled determination of whether adequate softening of the hair has occurred, so as to produce a satisfactory wave, and is normally expressed by the operator as the time of contact of the waving solution with the hair. When adequate test curl has been achieved, the waving solution is normally rinsed from the hair, and while the hair is still set on mandrels, an oxidizing agent is applied to fix the new curl pattern. The hair is subjected to a final rinse, possibly with conditioning, then dried. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to achieving permanent waves by a precise sequence of steps which reduce the potential of damage to the hair or scalp, shorten the overall waving cycle, and insure a better curl. In its broadest aspects, the invention resides in exposing hair wound on a mandrel to the action of a reactive waving solution containing at least one reducing agent capable of cystine cleavage, for a time sufficient to achieve substantially maximum bond cleavage; followed by blotting the hair to remove excess waving solution; then applying a suitable protein flow solution to enable protein flow to the desired curl configuration (reaction 4). This is followed by oxidation using an oxidizing agent to reestablish the cystine bonds to fix the curl. Preferably, the method involves contacting the conditioned hair with a waving solution comprised of at least one water-soluble mercaptan capable of cleaving the cystine bonds, and preferably present in combination with an alkali to maintain pH at from about 6 to about 10, and present in a concentration sufficient to achieve maximum bond-cleavage in from 5 to 15 minutes, contemporaneously with penetration of the hair; blotting excess waving solution from the hair; then contacting the hair with a suitable protein flow solution, preferably comprising an aqueous solution of at least one polyvalent ion and/or a hydroxyorganic compound containing one or more hydroxyl groups and up to about 4 carbon atoms at a pH of from 2 to about 10, for a period of from about 5 to about 10 minutes. This is followed by rinsing and reforming the cystine bonds through oxidation with a conventional peroxide or bromate oxidizing solution.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The instant invention will be detailed by a comparison of results achieved in conventional waving and the differences realized by practice of the instant invention. As used herein, the term &#34;maximum bond cleavage&#34; is defined as the maximum fraction of cystine (disulfide) bonds cleaved during the waving process, as determined by analysis of cysteine content with time. Normally, at least 30% cleavage of cystine is required, and from about 30% to about 50% is normally obtained in a successful wave. &#34;Test curl&#34; is the visual determination of softening to produce a satisfactory wave by one skilled in perming. It is expressed as the time of contact with the waving solution. &#34;Efficiency&#34; is the measure of appearance of curl tightness by waving hair on mandrels (pegs) of predetermined spacing. It is expressed as the percentage of maximum tightness, as determined by the geometry of spacing. High efficiencies represent tight-curl appearance but not necessarily resiliency. &#34;Resiliency&#34; is the measure of regain of curl or spring, as determined by extending or stressing the curl pattern waved on pegs of predetermined spacing. The tighter the return, or regain, the more resilient the curl formed. A curl may be tight in appearance, but not resilient. The converse is also true. &#34;Mature curl&#34; is the curl pattern that is found at the time of test curl, and is expressed as a resiliency value that is commercially acceptable, compared to resiliency of accepted perm products. &#34;Protein flow&#34; is the molecular rearrangement of the keratin-protein chains to form the curl pattern for the mature curl. In contrast to popular view, &#34;protein flow&#34; is not synonymous with &#34;cystine cleavage&#34;. By &#34;hydroxyorganic compound&#34; there is meant an alcohol or a polyol containing up to about 4 carbon atoms. By &#34;polyvalent ion&#34; there is meant an ion, when in solution, having a valence of at least 2. Cations are preferably present. However, anions have also been observed to be functional. Cystine cleavage is, in accordance with this invention, an operation independent of induced protein flow. As separate operations, more efficient permanent waves are achieved in shorter time spans with less client discomfort. The nature of the perming operation is to first shampoo the hair, then to wind the hair on mandrels. There is then applied to the hair a waving solution of at least one reductant for cystine (S--S) bonds, which may be from acid to alkaline in nature. Suitable reductants include thioglycolic acid; thiolactic acid; cysteine; salts and derivatives thereof; sulfite salts and the like. With reference to the background of the invention, alkaline, as opposed to acid, waving solutions are preferably used. This is because the acid waving solution is more-or-less limited, independent of waving solution concentration and application of heat, to the reaction of step 2, whereas steps 3 and 4 readily occur in an alkaline system having a pH greater than 7. Moreover, under acid conditions, fiber swelling is at a minimum, and ionic attractions between protein side-chains are at their maximum. It is for these reasons, in part, that thioglycolicacid and similar solutions at a pH between 5 and 7 are less preferred than waving solutions of the same agent at an alkaline pH. Under preferred alkaline conditions, the reaction, as indicated, proceeds well through step 3, with increased formation of cysteine (kSH) and concomitant loss of mixed-disulfide (kSSR) bonds. In addition, the protein chains bear an excess of negative charges, increasing hair swelling, which induces protein flow through repulsion. In consequence, the initial concentration of mixed disulfides is rapidly consumed, and the process normally proceeds through step 4 with attendant protein flow as determined by the skilled permer to have occurred, as a measure that a mature curl can be formed. It has now been found that substantially-maximum cystine cleavage (step 2) can be achieved using any conventional, reactive waving solution for about 5 minutes, with any excess time being created by reagent concentration, pH, temperature or hair condition. Normally, the maximum time is about 10 minutes, and cleavage is synchronous with penetration. Any time longer than about 15 minutes is unnecessary to the invention. This is because, in the practice of the instant invention, a secondary, less noxious means is used to induce protein flow, namely, the use of a protein flow solution as defined herein. As is conventional, cleavage for an acid waving solution proceeds through steps 1 and 2; and for an alkaline waving solution, cleavage proceeds to or into step 4. Independent of pH, the hair is blotted to remove excess waving solution, to maintain equilibrium of established cystine cleavage. Rinsing at this point is avoided because of reversal of step 2 to form cystine. Rather, protein flow is induced with a protein flow solution. Preferably, the protein flow solution employed is an aqueous solution of a water-soluble hydroxyorganic compound and/or a polyvalent ion, as detailed below. If the waving solution is based on glycerol monothioglycolate under generally neutral conditions, protein flow solutions described herein may be employed, since glycerol monothioglycolate is intermediate, and by the fact that it is more ionized under acid conditions, with a pK SH of 7.8 relative to a pK SH of 10.2 for thioglycolic acid. It is preferred, however, to employ a solution comprising at least one alcohol and/or polyol in combination with at least one polyvalent ion. Disrupting agents, such as urea, quanidine, amides, betaines and surfactants which aid in expanding the protein structure, may be included in the protein flow solutions employed. For practice of the instant invention, therefore, after treating the hair with the waving solution for a period of from about 5 to about 15 minutes, excess waving solution is blotted from the hair. This leaves the remainder in the fiber to maintain maximum bond cleavage for subsequent protein rearrangement with a protein flow solution. Protein rearrangement is then achieved by applying to the hair, an aqueous protein flow solution comprising at least one water-soluble salt of a polyvalent ion having an ionic charge of at least two, and acceptable toxicity. Magnesium and calcium salts are currently preferred. Salts may be used in concentrations up to solution saturation, normally in a concentration of from about 1 to about 10 percent by weight. Alternatively, but preferably in addition, there is employed at least one hydroxyorganic compound containing up to about 4 carbon atoms. It may be an alcohol and/or a polyol. Again, concentration may be up to solution saturation or to a concentration where the solution becomes hazardous to the client or to use. Illustrative but not limiting of functional compounds, there may be mentioned, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, isoamyl alcohol, propylene glycol and the like. Normally, 2-butanol is not used because of odor. Methanol is functional, but can present toxicity problems. Normally, the alcohol or the polyol is present in a concentration up to about 25 percent by weight of solution, preferably from about 1 to about 20 percent by weight, more preferably from about 2 to about 10 percent by weight. Solution pH may range from about 2 to about 10, preferably from about 6 to about 7, and may be adjusted by inclusion of alkaline compounds such as ammonia, alkaline amino acids, alkanolamines, alkali carbonates, and the like. Preferably, there are contained in the protein flow solution, wetting agents, such as nonionic, cationic or anionic detergents; conditioners, such as amino acids or proteins; polymers or water-soluble fatty derivatives, as thickeners; colorants; fragrance; preservatives, and the like. While not bound by theory, it is believed that the application of the ionic solution produces a concentration gradient, inducing the fibers to absorb positively-charged ions which neutralize negatively-charged protein side chains, causing increased protein mobility and inducing flow. The alcohol or polyol ingredient induces penetration and hydrophobic rearrangement of protein side chains further increasing thereby the propensity to flow. Protein flow is complete within a period of from 5 to 10 minutes, which is predetermined by the precise composition, temperature, and condition of the hair. In the practice of the instant invention, although two applications of solution are employed, the waving operation is faster, having a feasible maximum completion time of 15 minutes, with more repeatable and reliable results for the cleavage and rearrangement steps. Following addition of the protein flow solution to the hair, the hair is rinsed and the disulfide bonds are reformed through conventional oxidizing operations, as by application of peroxide and bromate rebonding solutions.

All establish that maximum or substantially maximum bond cleavage occurred in 5 minutes with, in the instance of GMTG, some gain in the 5-to-10-minute span. It was concluded, therefore, that in most instances, substantially maximum bond cleavage could be achieved in from 5 to 10 minutes. Control A In a controlled salon test, cystine and CMTC content of a controlled amount of hair were determined at various points in a waving operation. It established that the amount of cystine did not decrease, nor did mixed disulfides increase, with protracted contact with the waving solution. It also showed the strong influence of water on restoring the cystine bonds. The waving solution was composed of 11% by weight ammonium thioglycolate, a nonionic surfactant, at a pH of 7.0.

Penetration of a reducing agent into hair 2. kSSk+RSH⃡kSH+RSSk 3 kSSR+RSH⃡kSH+RSSR 4. Rearrangement of protein chains. 5. Setting the curl by reforming cystine bonds. It has been reported in the literature that under alkaline waving conditions, penetration is the slow step, with steps 2 and 3 presumably taking place as rapidly as penetration occurs. The fourth step is critical to the formation of a commercially acceptable curl. Under acid conditions, e.g., pH 5 to 7, it has been considered necessary to apply heat to achieve a proper curl. This is because step 2 is the dominant or limiting step. Under such conditions, the hair is highly susceptible to reformation of cystine bonds on rinsing through reversal of reaction 2. Under alkaline conditions, the reaction proceeds well through step 3, with increased formation of cysteine (kSH) and concomitant loss of mixed disulfide (kSSR). It is for this reason that alkaline waving solutions have been favored by the beauty industry. In conventional perming, therefore, the hair is contacted, after washing, with a waving solution of a reducing agent, normally a mercaptan, present in sufficient strength to cleave the cystine (disulfide) bond. Cleavage softens the protein structure (keratin) of the hair. Contact time depends on pH, the process used, and temperatures employed, which may be up to about 60° C. Wetting agents or other penetrants are normally employed to aid reduction. In practice, the key objective is to complete the waving process in less than one hour, with the safety and comfort of the client foremost in mind. Hair that has been chemically pretreated may be contacted with weaker solutions and for a lesser time than normal hair. Solutions of high reductant concentration may be required for hair difficult to treat, or to shorten process time. The operator normally determines whether there has been adequate processing of the hair, or that maximum bond breakage has occurred, by formation of a test curl. This determination involves unrolling the mandrel a couple of curls to ascertain if a &#34;soft S&#34; at the diameter of the mandrel pattern has formed. This is a subjective but skilled determination of whether adequate softening of the hair has occurred, so as to produce a satisfactory wave, and is normally expressed by the operator as the time of contact of the waving solution with the hair. When adequate test curl has been achieved, the waving solution is normally rinsed from the hair, and while the hair is still set on mandrels, an oxidizing agent is applied to fix the new curl pattern. The hair is subjected to a final rinse, possibly with conditioning, then dried. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to achieving permanent waves by a precise sequence of steps which reduce the potential of damage to the hair or scalp, shorten the overall waving cycle, and insure a better curl. In its broadest aspects, the invention resides in exposing hair wound on a mandrel to the action of a reactive waving solution containing at least one reducing agent capable of cystine cleavage, for a time sufficient to achieve substantially maximum bond cleavage; followed by blotting the hair to remove excess waving solution; then applying a suitable protein flow solution to enable protein flow to the desired curl configuration (reaction 4). This is followed by oxidation using an oxidizing agent to reestablish the cystine bonds to fix the curl. Preferably, the method involves contacting the conditioned hair with a waving solution comprised of at least one water-soluble mercaptan capable of cleaving the cystine bonds, and preferably present in combination with an alkali to maintain pH at from about 6 to about 10, and present in a concentration sufficient to achieve maximum bond-cleavage in from 5 to 15 minutes, contemporaneously with penetration of the hair; blotting excess waving solution from the hair; then contacting the hair with a suitable protein flow solution, preferably comprising an aqueous solution of at least one polyvalent ion and/or a hydroxyorganic compound containing one or more hydroxyl groups and up to about 4 carbon atoms at a pH of from 2 to about 10, for a period of from about 5 to about 10 minutes. This is followed by rinsing and reforming the cystine bonds through oxidation with a conventional peroxide or bromate oxidizing solution.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The instant invention will be detailed by a comparison of results achieved in conventional waving and the differences realized by practice of the instant invention. As used herein, the term &#34;maximum bond cleavage&#34; is defined as the maximum fraction of cystine (disulfide) bonds cleaved during the waving process, as determined by analysis of cysteine content with time. Normally, at least 30% cleavage of cystine is required, and from about 30% to about 50% is normally obtained in a successful wave. &#34;Test curl&#34; is the visual determination of softening to produce a satisfactory wave by one skilled in perming. It is expressed as the time of contact with the waving solution. &#34;Efficiency&#34; is the measure of appearance of curl tightness by waving hair on mandrels (pegs) of predetermined spacing. It is expressed as the percentage of maximum tightness, as determined by the geometry of spacing. High efficiencies represent tight-curl appearance but not necessarily resiliency. &#34;Resiliency&#34; is the measure of regain of curl or spring, as determined by extending or stressing the curl pattern waved on pegs of predetermined spacing. The tighter the return, or regain, the more resilient the curl formed. A curl may be tight in appearance, but not resilient. The converse is also true. &#34;Mature curl&#34; is the curl pattern that is found at the time of test curl, and is expressed as a resiliency value that is commercially acceptable, compared to resiliency of accepted perm products. &#34;Protein flow&#34; is the molecular rearrangement of the keratin-protein chains to form the curl pattern for the mature curl. In contrast to popular view, &#34;protein flow&#34; is not synonymous with &#34;cystine cleavage&#34;. By &#34;hydroxyorganic compound&#34; there is meant an alcohol or a polyol containing up to about 4 carbon atoms. By &#34;polyvalent ion&#34; there is meant an ion, when in solution, having a valence of at least 2. Cations are preferably present. However, anions have also been observed to be functional. Cystine cleavage is, in accordance with this invention, an operation independent of induced protein flow. As separate operations, more efficient permanent waves are achieved in shorter time spans with less client discomfort. The nature of the perming operation is to first shampoo the hair, then to wind the hair on mandrels. There is then applied to the hair a waving solution of at least one reductant for cystine (S--S) bonds, which may be from acid to alkaline in nature. Suitable reductants include thioglycolic acid; thiolactic acid; cysteine; salts and derivatives thereof; sulfite salts and the like. With reference to the background of the invention, alkaline, as opposed to acid, waving solutions are preferably used. This is because the acid waving solution is more-or-less limited, independent of waving solution concentration and application of heat, to the reaction of step 2, whereas steps 3 and 4 readily occur in an alkaline system having a pH greater than 7. Moreover, under acid conditions, fiber swelling is at a minimum, and ionic attractions between protein side-chains are at their maximum. It is for these reasons, in part, that thioglycolicacid and similar solutions at a pH between 5 and 7 are less preferred than waving solutions of the same agent at an alkaline pH. Under preferred alkaline conditions, the reaction, as indicated, proceeds well through step 3, with increased formation of cysteine (kSH) and concomitant loss of mixed-disulfide (kSSR) bonds. In addition, the protein chains bear an excess of negative charges, increasing hair swelling, which induces protein flow through repulsion. In consequence, the initial concentration of mixed disulfides is rapidly consumed, and the process normally proceeds through step 4 with attendant protein flow as determined by the skilled permer to have occurred, as a measure that a mature curl can be formed. It has now been found that substantially-maximum cystine cleavage (step 2) can be achieved using any conventional, reactive waving solution for about 5 minutes, with any excess time being created by reagent concentration, pH, temperature or hair condition. Normally, the maximum time is about 10 minutes, and cleavage is synchronous with penetration. Any time longer than about 15 minutes is unnecessary to the invention. This is because, in the practice of the instant invention, a secondary, less noxious means is used to induce protein flow, namely, the use of a protein flow solution as defined herein. As is conventional, cleavage for an acid waving solution proceeds through steps 1 and 2; and for an alkaline waving solution, cleavage proceeds to or into step 4. Independent of pH, the hair is blotted to remove excess waving solution, to maintain equilibrium of established cystine cleavage. Rinsing at this point is avoided because of reversal of step 2 to form cystine. Rather, protein flow is induced with a protein flow solution. Preferably, the protein flow solution employed is an aqueous solution of a water-soluble hydroxyorganic compound and/or a polyvalent ion, as detailed below. If the waving solution is based on glycerol monothioglycolate under generally neutral conditions, protein flow solutions described herein may be employed, since glycerol monothioglycolate is intermediate, and by the fact that it is more ionized under acid conditions, with a pK SH of 7.8 relative to a pK SH of 10.2 for thioglycolic acid. It is preferred, however, to employ a solution comprising at least one alcohol and/or polyol in combination with at least one polyvalent ion. Disrupting agents, such as urea, quanidine, amides, betaines and surfactants which aid in expanding the protein structure, may be included in the protein flow solutions employed. For practice of the instant invention, therefore, after treating the hair with the waving solution for a period of from about 5 to about 15 minutes, excess waving solution is blotted from the hair. This leaves the remainder in the fiber to maintain maximum bond cleavage for subsequent protein rearrangement with a protein flow solution. Protein rearrangement is then achieved by applying to the hair, an aqueous protein flow solution comprising at least one water-soluble salt of a polyvalent ion having an ionic charge of at least two, and acceptable toxicity. Magnesium and calcium salts are currently preferred. Salts may be used in concentrations up to solution saturation, normally in a concentration of from about 1 to about 10 percent by weight. Alternatively, but preferably in addition, there is employed at least one hydroxyorganic compound containing up to about 4 carbon atoms. It may be an alcohol and/or a polyol. Again, concentration may be up to solution saturation or to a concentration where the solution becomes hazardous to the client or to use. Illustrative but not limiting of functional compounds, there may be mentioned, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, isoamyl alcohol, propylene glycol and the like. Normally, 2-butanol is not used because of odor. Methanol is functional, but can present toxicity problems. Normally, the alcohol or the polyol is present in a concentration up to about 25 percent by weight of solution, preferably from about 1 to about 20 percent by weight, more preferably from about 2 to about 10 percent by weight. Solution pH may range from about 2 to about 10, preferably from about 6 to about 7, and may be adjusted by inclusion of alkaline compounds such as ammonia, alkaline amino acids, alkanolamines, alkali carbonates, and the like. Preferably, there are contained in the protein flow solution, wetting agents, such as nonionic, cationic or anionic detergents; conditioners, such as amino acids or proteins; polymers or water-soluble fatty derivatives, as thickeners; colorants; fragrance; preservatives, and the like. While not bound by theory, it is believed that the application of the ionic solution produces a concentration gradient, inducing the fibers to absorb positively-charged ions which neutralize negatively-charged protein side chains, causing increased protein mobility and inducing flow. The alcohol or polyol ingredient induces penetration and hydrophobic rearrangement of protein side chains further increasing thereby the propensity to flow. Protein flow is complete within a period of from 5 to 10 minutes, which is predetermined by the precise composition, temperature, and condition of the hair. In the practice of the instant invention, although two applications of solution are employed, the waving operation is faster, having a feasible maximum completion time of 15 minutes, with more repeatable and reliable results for the cleavage and rearrangement steps. Following addition of the protein flow solution to the hair, the hair is rinsed and the disulfide bonds are reformed through conventional oxidizing operations, as by application of peroxide and bromate rebonding solutions.

      "Changed 'catheter' by 'patient' in 'CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application is a divisional of and claims priority to patent application Ser. No. 13/071594, filed Mar. 25, 2011, entitled SPRAY NOZZLE DESIGN FOR A CATHETER, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002] n/a TECHNICAL FIELD [0003] The disclosure relates to catheter-based medical devices, and more particularly to mechanisms and methods for controlling the dispersion of cryogenic fluid from a cryoablation catheter. BACKGROUND [0004] Many medical procedures are performed using minimally invasive surgical techniques wherein one or more devices are inserted through one or more small incisions into a patient&#39;s body. For example, a cardiac arrhythmia may be treated through selective ablation of cardiac tissue to eliminate the source of the arrhythmia. Radio frequency energy, microwave energy, laser energy, extreme heat, or extreme cold may be provided by the ablation device to ablate the tissue. [0005] One category of such ablation devices is the minimally-invasive, catheter-based device that is introduced into the vasculature and used to treat tissue by cooling contact. Such catheter-based devices, henceforth generically referred to herein simply as “catheters” have an elongated body through which a cooling fluid circulates to a tip portion which is adapted to contact and cool tissue. The cooling fluid used with such catheters may be a low temperature fluid, or cryogens. In general, the catheters may be used to lower the temperature of tissue, such as cardiac wall tissue, to an extent such that signal generation or conduction ceases and allows one to map or confirm that the catheter is positioned at a particular lesion or arrhythmia conduction site. More recently, cryoablation catheters have been configured for ablation treatment, to cool the tissue to a much lower level at which freezing destroys the viability of the tissue, and, in the case of cardiac tissue, permanently removes it as a signal generating or signal conducting locus. Such devices are also useful for tissue destruction in other contexts, such as the ablation of tumorous, diseased, precancerous or congenitally abnormal tissue. [0006] The catheters may be adapted for endovascular insertion, or for insertion along relatively confined pathways, for example through a body lumen, or through a small incision to and around intervening organs, to reach an intended ablation site. As such, they are characterized by a relatively elongated body through which the cooling fluid circulates, and a tip or distal end portion where the cooling is to be applied. The requirement that the coolant be localized in its activity poses stringent constraints on a working device. For example, when the catheter contact must chill tissue to below freezing, the coolant itself must attain a substantially lower temperature. The rate of cooling is limited by the ability to supply coolant and circulate it through the active contact region, and the efficacy of the contact region itself is further limited by geometry and physical properties that affect its ability to conduct heat into the tissue. [0007] Furthermore, it is generally desirable to control the direction of the cryogenic fluid flow to only the target tissue sites. In some procedures, a spot tissue ablation procedure—where the fluid flow is directed at a specific site—may be acceptable. For other procedures, it may be more therapeutically effective if the fluid flow is directed along a predetermined line, or a single elongate ring or linear lesion created in a single ablative step. However, the small dimensions of the catheter assembly have the result that flow conditions existing within the catheter tip are turbulent and chaotic. This arises in part because the high pressure release of fluid in a relatively small chamber at the tip of the catheter and/or its recirculation back via a return conduit from the tip region involve relatively turbulent fluid flow conditions, so that the precise control of directional contact on the tissue may be subject to rather wide variations. Thus, while conventional catheter arrangements have been found to provide a high level of cooling, the introduction at high pressure into the small expansion chamber results in cavitation, turbulence and irregular fluid flow evolving in the short distance and brief time between the jet spray of expanding coolant and the lower pressure conditions existing at the proximal end of the chamber adjacent the coolant return passage. [0008] Accordingly, cryoablation catheters could benefit from improved techniques and devices for providing uniform and evenly controlled flow of the thermal transfer fluid onto the targeted tissue cells. SUMMARY [0009] The disclosure generally describes a cryoablation catheter for use in tissue ablation. The catheter comprises an elongate supply lumen, or injection tube, which carries a cryofluid or refrigerant from a refrigerant supply unit. Typically, a source of refrigerant is connected to the proximal end of the supply lumen and a cryochamber, or expandable chamber, is located at the lumen&#39;s distal end. In some embodiments, the source of refrigerant is a fluid that is ejected from the supply lumen through an orifice coupled at a distal portion of the lumen and housed within the expandable chamber. The catheter also comprises a fluid dispersion unit that is also housed, at least partially, within the expandable chamber. At the predetermined pressures to which the cryoablation fluid is subjected, the construction of the fluid dispersion unit must be so designed and dimensioned to disperse a definite amount of fluid within certain limits. The dispersion unit of the present disclosure serves to evenly distribute the refrigerant exiting the distal end of the supply lumen across at least some portion of the interior of the expansion chamber. [0010] Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosure teach fluid dispersion units which control the distribution of fluid flowing therethrough. In one example, the fluid dispersion unit comprises a flow distribution sleeve that induces in a fluid expelled from there sleeve a motion having a predetermined pattern. In another example, the fluid dispersion unit comprises a deflection member that redirects the direction of flow of a fluid in a predetermined pattern. In yet another example, the fluid dispersion unit comprises an arrangement of the flow distribution sleeve and the deflection member. [0011] In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, a fluid nozzle is disposed on the distal end of a supply lumen. The fluid nozzle is disposed within a fluid dispersion unit in a predetermined arrangement. In some examples, the arrangement of the fluid nozzle and the fluid dispersion unit causes fluid flowing from the nozzle to undergo a predetermined motion. [0012] Other embodiments disclose a catheter which includes an outer tubular member capable of insertion into the vessels of the body. An expandable chamber, such as a distendable balloon, is disposed at the distal end of the outer tubular member. An inner tubular member substantially spanning the length of the outer tubular member may be employed to carry a fluid to the interior of the expandable chamber. A fluid nozzle is disposed on the distal end of the inner tubular member. A fluid dispersion unit is provided in fluidic-communication with the fluid dispersion unit for controlling the direction of dispersion of the fluid. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0013] The following drawings are illustrative of particular embodiments of the present disclosure and therefore do not limit the scope of the disclosure. The drawings (not to scale) are intended for use in conjunction with the explanations in the following detailed description, wherein similar elements are designated by identical reference numerals. Moreover, the specific location of the various features is merely exemplary unless noted otherwise. [0014] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary ablation catheter of the present disclosure as it would be deployed and used for an ablation procedure; [0015] FIG. 2 shows a cryogenic treatment system in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure; [0016] FIG. 3 depicts a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an exemplary catheter tip in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated; [0017] FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a catheter constructed in accordance with principles of this disclosure; [0018] FIG. 5 illustrates an embodiment of a catheter tip constructed in accordance with principles of this disclosure; and [0019] FIGS. 6-8 illustrate alternative embodiments of a catheter in accordance with the present disclosure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0020] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the disclosure. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments of the disclosure and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the disclosure. [0021] In one aspect, the catheter described herein can be used for performing ablation near or within the pulmonary veins of the heart where an ablation band that may have a circumferential or linear geometry across the targeted tissue is formed. However, the devices described herein are not limited to cardiac applications. [0022] To better understand the environment in which the devices and methods of the present disclosure are used, a general overview of an ablation procedure is believed to be useful. The example pertains to a catheter-based ablation treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, wherein a specific area of cardiac tissue having aberrant conductive pathways, such as atrial rotors, emitting or conducting erratic electrical impulses, is cold-treated through energy transfer derived from thermodynamic changes occurring in the flow of a cryogenic fluid through the catheter device. This energy transfer creates a net transfer of heat from the target tissue to the device, typically achieved by cooling a portion of the device to very low temperature through conductive and convective heat transfer between the cryogen and target tissue. [0023] Referring to FIG. 1 , the treatment to be accomplished with the devices, systems and methods described in this disclosure is illustrated. FIG. 1 shows a cutaway view of the human heart 10 , showing the major structures of the heart 10 including the left and right atria, and the pulmonary veins 15 a, 15 b. The atrial septum separates the left and right atria. The fossa ovalis 11 is a small depression in the atrial septum that may be used as an access pathway to the left atrium from the right atrium, such as with a transeptal puncture device and transeptal sheath. The fossa ovalis 11 can be punctured, and easily reseals and heals after procedure completion. In a patient suffering from atrial fibrillation, aberrant electrically conducive tissue may be found in the atrial walls, as well as in the pulmonary veins 15 a, 15 b. Ablation of these areas, referred to as arrhythmogenic foci (also referred to as drivers or rotors), is an effective treatment for atrial fibrillation. Systems, devices and methods of the present disclosure provide means of creating lesions, including lesions to surround the pulmonary vein ostia, and are deployed to identify and ablate the driver and rotor tissue. [0024] To accomplish this, a catheter ( FIG. 2 ) is inserted into the right atrium, preferably through the inferior vena cava or through the superior vena cava. The catheter is sized for advancement through the patient&#39;s vasculature. As an example, which is not intended to be limiting, an exemplary catheter may have a shaft having a diameter ranging from 7-9 Fr, with the shaft length ranging from 100-125 cm and the overall length being in the range of 140-160 cm. The catheter may be passed through transeptal sheath, which may or may not be a deflectable sheath since the catheter preferably includes a deflectable distal portion. When passing into the left atrium, the transeptal sheath passes through or penetrates the fossa ovalis 11 , such as over guide wire 17 which may have been placed by the transeptal puncture device. The catheter is inserted over guide wire 17 and through transeptal sheath such that its distal end enters the lumen of right superior pulmonary vein 15 a, 15 b. The catheter carries an ablating element, such as an expandable chamber ( FIG. 2 ) into the left atrium. The expandable chamber is transitioned to expand to a maximal diameter by, for example inflation, such that the expandable chamber is in contact with the walls of the target tissue e.g., pulmonary vein ostia to occlude the vein. [0025] An electrical mapping procedure may be performed to identify or confirm the location of the target cardiac tissue. Next, a treatment medium (e.g., cryogenic fluid) provided by a source external to the patient, is provided through the catheter into the ablating element to ablate the neighboring tissue and form a lesion. The system may utilize various systems, such as the Joule-Thompson effect, to achieve the cooling including the exemplary systems described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,780,657 to Abboud et al., entitled “COOLING SYSTEM,” which issued on Aug. 24, 2010, and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, in one embodiment, a pressurized liquid or a liquid/gas mixture passes into a region where it is enabled to evaporate. In other embodiments, a cryogenic fluid delivered to an expandable balloon is a pressurized gas wherein expansion of the pressurized fluid effects the cooling. Accordingly, the cooling methods may allow for expansion of a compressed fluid independent of whether there is a phase change and/or may include phase changes from liquid to gas or an expanded gas being cooled to such an extent that a portion of the expanded gas actually condenses into a liquid phase. Suitable cryogenic fluids will be non-toxic and include nitrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and the like. By delivering the cryogenic fluid through the catheter body, the balloon can be expanded and cooled in order to effect treatments according to the present disclosure. [0026] The created lesions may be segmented and localized. The lesions may be linear or curvilinear, circumferential and partial circumferential, and/or continuous or discontinuous. The lesions created by the ablation catheters are suitable for inhibiting the propagation of inappropriate electrical impulses in the heart 10 for prevention of reentrant arrhythmias. In general, the catheter ablation therapy will disrupt the electrical pathways in cardiac tissue to stop the emission of and/or prevent the propagation of erratic electric impulses. [0027] FIG. 2 shows a cryogenic treatment system 20 in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. System 20 includes a treatment catheter 22 having a handle 24 , and elongated cryogen transporting body 26 and a catheter tip 28 (described in more detail in FIG. 3 ). The catheter 22 is connected by various conduits or cables to a console 30 which may, for example, have a display monitor 32 and other data entry or display accessories such as a keyboard, a printer and the like. Operation of the console 30 involves controlling the timing and amount of coolant injected through the catheter 22 at a defined injection pressure, which may be a pressure of about 400 psig, for example. The entire catheter 22 may be dimensioned to fit in a No. 14 French introducer or smaller. The console 32 is connected to the catheter 22 by various lines 34 which may include a coolant injection line 36 , a coolant return line 38 and electrical cabling 40 which carries outputs of various cardiac sensing, thermal sensing, mapping or other elements as may be used for catheter treatment or monitoring. As shown, the handle 24 is equipped with input ports for an electrical connector 42 , a coolant injection tube connector 44 , and a return tube connector 46. These connect by various internal junctions or tubes passing through the handle and elongated body 26 to the distal tip of the catheter. The handle 24 may also include various control assemblies, e.g., switches or valves, as well as safety detection or shutdown elements (not illustrated). [0028] Turning to FIG. 3 , a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an exemplary catheter tip in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated. Tip 28 of the exemplary catheter 22 comprises an outer tube 50 which may be coupled to an outer balloon 52. An inner balloon 54 may be disposed within the outer balloon 52. The void within inner balloon 54 defines an expandable chamber 56. In use, both the outer balloon 52 and inner balloon 54 may be expanded concurrently to contact a blood vessel or other tissue during an ablation procedure. Although the exemplary embodiment depicts a gap between portions of the outer balloon 52 and inner balloon 54 , it should be noted that the entire perimeter of both outer balloon 52 and inner balloon 54 may be in contact. The outer balloon 52 contains leaks in the inner balloon 54 should they occur. Low pressure or vacuum return lumens 58 and 58 ′ may be in fluid communication with the interior of the outer and inner balloons, respectively. [0029] Outer tube 50 defines a lumen that may circumferentially enclose an injection tube 60 so that the tubes may be substantially coaxially disposed with respect to each other, such that a longitudinal centerline (not shown) of outer tuber 50 approximately coincides with the longitudinal centerline (not shown) of injection tube 60. Injection tube 60 may substantially span the length of outer tube 50 and may terminate at a point slightly more distal to the absolute distal end of outer tube 50 such as within the second balloon 60. Injection tube 60 will generally be in fluid communication with the coolant injection line 36 ( FIG. 2 ) while the return lumens 58 and 58 ′ will typically be in fluid communication with coolant return line 38 ( FIG. 2 ). However, other implementations in accordance with the principles set forth herein are contemplated. For example, while the injection tube 60 in fluid communication with injection line 36 have been illustrated as being separate components, other exemplary embodiments may combine both components into a unitary component. [0030] Injection tube 60 may be disposed over a guidewire structure such as a tube, a shim or the guide wire 17 that passes through or is contained within the lumen defined by outer tube 50.'.\n",

System 20 includes a treatment catheter 22 having a handle 24 , and elongated cryogen transporting body 26 and a catheter tip 28 (described in more detail in FIG. 3 ). The catheter 22 is connected by various conduits or cables to a console 30 which may, for example, have a display monitor 32 and other data entry or display accessories such as a keyboard, a printer and the like. Operation of the console 30 involves controlling the timing and amount of coolant injected through the catheter 22 at a defined injection pressure, which may be a pressure of about 400 psig, for example. The entire catheter 22 may be dimensioned to fit in a No. 14 French introducer or smaller. The console 32 is connected to the catheter 22 by various lines 34 which may include a coolant injection line 36 , a coolant return line 38 and electrical cabling 40 which carries outputs of various cardiac sensing, thermal sensing, mapping or other elements as may be used for catheter treatment or monitoring. As shown, the handle 24 is equipped with input ports for an electrical connector 42 , a coolant injection tube connector 44 , and a return tube connector 46. These connect by various internal junctions or tubes passing through the handle and elongated body 26 to the distal tip of the catheter. The handle 24 may also include various control assemblies, e.g., switches or valves, as well as safety detection or shutdown elements (not illustrated). [0028] Turning to FIG. 3 , a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an exemplary catheter tip in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated. Tip 28 of the exemplary catheter 22 comprises an outer tube 50 which may be coupled to an outer balloon 52. An inner balloon 54 may be disposed within the outer balloon 52. The void within inner balloon 54 defines an expandable chamber 56. In use, both the outer balloon 52 and inner balloon 54 may be expanded concurrently to contact a blood vessel or other tissue during an ablation procedure. Although the exemplary embodiment depicts a gap between portions of the outer balloon 52 and inner balloon 54 , it should be noted that the entire perimeter of both outer balloon 52 and inner balloon 54 may be in contact. The outer balloon 52 contains leaks in the inner balloon 54 should they occur. Low pressure or vacuum return lumens 58 and 58 ′ may be in fluid communication with the interior of the outer and inner balloons, respectively. [0029] Outer tube 50 defines a lumen that may circumferentially enclose an injection tube 60 so that the tubes may be substantially coaxially disposed with respect to each other, such that a longitudinal centerline (not shown) of outer tuber 50 approximately coincides with the longitudinal centerline (not shown) of injection tube 60. Injection tube 60 may substantially span the length of outer tube 50 and may terminate at a point slightly more distal to the absolute distal end of outer tube 50 such as within the second balloon 60. Injection tube 60 will generally be in fluid communication with the coolant injection line 36 ( FIG. 2 ) while the return lumens 58 and 58 ′ will typically be in fluid communication with coolant return line 38 ( FIG. 2 ). However, other implementations in accordance with the principles set forth herein are contemplated. For example, while the injection tube 60 in fluid communication with injection line 36 have been illustrated as being separate components, other exemplary embodiments may combine both components into a unitary component. [0030] Injection tube 60 may be disposed over a guidewire structure such as a tube, a shim or the guide wire 17 that passes through or is contained within the lumen defined by outer tube 50.'.\n",

      "Changed 'apparatus' by 'pump' in 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is directed to a method and to an apparatus for producing X-ray exposures of body parts of a human, particularly X-ray tomograms of the jaw or skull of a patient, whereby a ray beam generated by a radiation source and limited by a diaphragm aperture of a primary diaphragm strikes a detector arrangement after penetrating through the exposure subject, the detector arrangement having at least one X-ray image-acquiring detector element. 2. Description of the Prior Art Methods and apparatuses are employed in dental radiology with which it is possible to produce tomograms of a human, particularly of the region of the jaw. A particular application is the production of tomograms whose slice proceeds perpendicular to the mandibular arch. Such tomograms are called transversal sections. Compared to otherwise standard panorama tomograms, such transversal sections exhibit an especially small range of the depth of field. European Application 0 229 971 discloses an apparatus with which such tomograms are produced on an X-ray film. European Application 0 632 994 discloses an apparatus for producing X-ray exposures digitally. To this end, a line detector camera with a detector that is implemented as a single-stage or multi-stage CCD sensor is provided. Dependent on whether a single-stage or multi-stage sensor is employed, the dimensions of the detector arrangement typically amount to 135 through 180 mm in the image height and approximately 6 mm in the image width. These dimensions take into account, first, the image acquisition size necessary for a good diagnosis and, second, an adequate depth of field when viewing the individual slices. It has been shown in practice that the diaphragm system and detector system must be matched such that the usable ray fan for transversal slices, i.e. for the aforementioned transversal sections, must exhibit a width of at least 20 mm in the detector plane in order to be able to achieve a range of approximately 1 through 3 mm for the depth of field. A detector arrangement on the order of the aforementioned size is comparatively expensive with current technology. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus with which it is possible to produce tomograms of the type described above with a smaller, more economical detector surface area. A significantly smaller and thus more economic detector can be utilized in the exposure procedure that inventively ensues in a number of chronologically separated sections for which the detector or a detector arrangement composed of a number of detectors is arranged in different positions. It is especially economical when the detector employed exhibits the dimension of a detector of the type known as an intra-oral sensor, as is currently employed for intra-oral exposures, or when a complete intra-oral sensor of this type is utilized as the detector. Typically, such sensors have dimensions of about 30×20 mm. The sensor of the type already used per se for intra-oral exposures thus can also be employed for extra-oral exposures (dual use). When a number of transversal tomograms are to be produced, it can be advantageous to implement the sub-exposures not only in the forward phase but also in the return phase of the rotary unit that carries the X-ray source and the detector arrangement. The overall exposure sequence thus can be significantly accelerated. Also for shortening the exposure sequence, it can be advantageous to undertake a detector displacement only when all transversal tomograms for one position, i.e. for one sub-exposure position of the detector arrangement, have been completed. It can also be advantageous to provide a number of detectors and to arrange these spaced from each other. Such an arrangement with a number of detectors is still more economical than a detector arrangement having the initially described image acquisition size.

FIG. 10 shows a fifth embodiment of a detector arrangement useable in the method and apparatus of the invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In a schematic illustration, FIG. 1 shows a dental X-ray diagnostic apparatus for producing panorama tomograms that, according to the invention, can also be utilized for the production of transversal sections. The apparatus contains a height-adjustable carrying column 1 at which a rotary unit 2 is held. The rotary unit 2 carries an X-ray source 3 and an X-ray detector camera 4 diametrically opposite. A head retainer and positioning arrangement 5 allows the patients head to be fixed in a defined position in a known way. The structure as well as adjustment possibilities of the rotary unit 2 and of the head retainer and positioning arrangement 5 are known and, for example, are disclosed in the initially cited European Application 0 632 994. The line camera 4 is composed of an oblong housing having a slot (not referenced in detail) at its side facing toward the radiation source 3. A detector arrangement 8 having one or more radiation-sensitive detectors, for example in the form of CCD sensors, is located in the inside of the camera 4 behind the slot. The component structure and arrangement shall be explained in greater detail below. The detector arrangement 8 is held inside the line detector camera 4 so as to be adjustable in the direction of its longitudinal axis in the direction of the arrow 6. A detector arrangement 8 having two active detector elements forms the basis for the following discussion. This arrangement 8 represents only one of several possible embodiments within the scope of the invention. A diaphragm system 7, which contains the primary diaphragm, is held so as to be synchronously adjustable relative to the detector camera 4. The electromechanical connection of the line detector camera 4 with the diaphragm system is explained in greater detail with reference to FIG. 2. The detector elements (to be explained in greater detail below) arranged in the inside of the detector camera 4 can be adjusted along the principal detector axis with a suitable adjustment mechanism, such as with a stepping motor 9 and a spindle 10. Via a serial interface 11, the stepping motor 9 communicates with a control electronics 12 of the apparatus controller of the apparatus. Via a further interface 13, the control electronics 12 forwards control commands to an actuating drive 14 arranged at the X-ray source 3. The synchronous adjustment of a primary diaphragm 15 of the diaphragm system 7 ensues with this actuating drive 14. The primary diaphragm 15 contains two diaphragm apertures 16 arranged spaced from each other. The X-rays emitted by the radiation source 3 are thus divided into two ray beams 17, 17&#39; that are focussed such that they exactly strike two detectors 18, 18&#39; arranged in the inside of the line detector camera 4. The two detectors 18, 18&#39; are arranged on a carrier 19 that, as described, is adjustable in the indicated arrow direction with the adjustment mechanism. FIG. 3 shows the detector arrangement in a front view. The carrier 19 on which the two detectors 18, 18&#39; are secured is displaceably held in a frame Clock-out registers 21, 21&#39; of the detectors, as can be seen from the coordinate reference at the right in FIG. 3, are fashioned as horizontal registers, i.e. in the TDI direction (TDI stands for Time Delay and Integration and is a term employed in CCD technology), which proceeds transversely relative to the displacement direction. Two readout registers 22, 22&#39; in one embodiment must be provided when one wishes to implement the clocking-out in the opposite direction, i.e. when one wishes to make sub-exposures during the return phase of the rotary unit 2. Drive electronics 23 is provided for the two detectors 18, 18&#39;. FIG. 4 shows an individual detector 18 having the dimensions standard for intra-oral sensors. Such sensors typically have a height (h) of 30 mm and a width (b) of 20 mm. The sensor surface irradiated by radiation is referenced Ai and has a height (h&#39;) of 26 mm and a width (b&#39;) of 18 mm. FIG. 5 shows a detector arrangement having a number of detectors. The detector area (A tot ) required for the subject exposure is divided into n areas, the sub-area A corresponding to the nth part of the total detector area (A tot ). Each sub-area is composed of m sensor areas (Ai), with m representing the number of detectors employed. Two detectors 18, 18&#39; are provided in this example. The irradiated sub-area A resulting from this arrangement amounts to 2×Ai. In relation thereto, the total detector area required for the exposure of a subject is referenced A tot. Let it be assumed that this total area (A tot ) should amount to H×B=100 mm×20 mm. The two detectors 18, 18&#39; are secured to the carrier 19 at the spacing (a) from one another, with the spacing (a) being dimensioned such that the irradiated sub-areas supplement one another to form a complete image without any deterioration being perceptible at the image transitions. In the arrangement shown as an example, the detector and the radiation fan beam are respectively shifted by approximately 25 mm in the arrow direction, i.e. along the longitudinal axis of the detectors. In order to achieve the indicated overall height of about 100 mm, accordingly, two exposure (image acquisition) phases are needed, a first in the illustrated basic position and a second wherein the two detectors are shifted by approximately 25 mm in the arrow direction. Alternatively, an arrangement with only one detector can be provided. In order to reduce the number of exposure phases, it is alternatively possible to partly or completely close the gaps (that have arisen due to the detectors being spaced with the distance (a)) with additional detectors. It is assumed that a mere joining of the detectors to one another in the prescribed image detector plane cannot be realized without influences that limit the image quality since inactive joint structures that do not contribute to the image acquisition arise at the abutting locations. In order to avoid these disadvantages, the gap is closed by detectors which are arranged in a second image detector plane farther from the x-ray source. FIGS. 9 and 10 show such an arrangement. Here, the detectors are arranged overlapping, so that a greater part of the line or the entire line can be irradiated in an exposure phase. The advantage of this arrangement is a reduction in the number of exposure phases and the elimination of a complicated diaphragm control, since no sub-areas have to be blanked out. Since the costs per active detector area rise disproportionately with those of the detector area, the use of further, small detectors is an economical solution. Occlusions which may be produced by detectors arranged in the first plane can be corrected with standard image processing techniques such as, for example, gain and artifact correction, insofar as these occlusions are produced by inactive detector structures. In addition to being defined by other parameters, the slice to be resolved is defined by the position attitude of the image detector planes. When, as described, two or even more different detector planes are used for the acquisition of a slice, then this can negatively influence the desired slice resolution. It has been shown in practice that an offset of up to 3 mm does not require any compensatory measures. For compensation (when needed), the charges can be moved with different speeds in the detector. In TDI technology, the charges in the detectors of the second plane are moved faster with a higher TDI clock rate than the charge in those detectors that are arranged closer to the radiator. Analogous thereto, this compensation can also ensue in the &#34;full frame mode&#34;. In this case, four exposure phases with quadruple displacement of the detector respectively by about 25 mm are required. The executive sequence for achieving transversal slice exposures is explained in greater detail on the basis of FIG. 6. It is assumed that four transverse sections are to be recorded in the four indicated slice planes S1, S2, S3 and S4. The operator first selects the exposure parameters (examined region, number, quality and size of the transverse sections as well as dose). These parameters can ensue at the apparatus itself or at a connected PC by selecting pre-defined programs, or can ensue by manual setting of the parameters. The exposure sequence is started after positioning the patient in the head retainer and positioning arrangement 5 (FIG. 1). The apparatus first adjusts itself by approaching reference points and subsequently positions itself in a start position for the following exposure series. The number of individual exposures is derived on the basis of the number of transversal slice exposures and the number of exposure phases. Let it be assumed in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 6 that four different tomograms S1 through S4 of the left temperomaxillary joint and, subsequently, four more tomograms S1&#39; through S4&#39; of a further jaw section of the illustrated mandibular arch, are to be produced. The rotary unit 2 is first moved into the position P1, from which the X-ray source 3 can emit rays onto the desired imaging region that, for example, should film the illustrated angle α. The tomogram S1 is produced by, beginning from an initial position rotating the rotary unit 2 through the angle α. After the exposure for the slice position S1 has been produced, the X-ray source 3 is turned off and the rotary unit 2 is moved back by the swivel angle a into the initial position. Subsequently, the slice positions S2, S3 and S4 are produced in succession. Other slice positions for further subject portions can be analogously produced, for example proceeding from the position P2, as shown. The kinematic motion sequence of the rotary unit 2 carrying the X-ray source 2 and line detector camera 4 is known, as is the drive of the detectors according to the TDI method required in order to obtain the desired layer. In this last-described exposure procedure, the actual exposure with radiation is implemented during forward running of the rotary unit 2. The radiation is turned off in the return phase or is rendered ineffective by a diaphragm adjustment. There are a number of possibilities for acquiring the four slices in the exemplary embodiment. One way is to first completely produce one slice, i.e. initially implementing two exposure sequences with a detector displacement given (a detector arrangement with two detectors) and correspondingly registering the further slices S2, S3 and S4 thereafter. Alternatively, there is the possibility of registering all four slices in one detector position, subsequently displacing the detector arrangement and in turn subsequently registering all four slices in the second detector position. This version has the advantage that further motion events are not needed, which may slow the overall executive sequence. As already initially addressed, it can be advantageous to implement tomograms during the return run of the rotary unit 2. To that end, it is necessary to equip the detectors with a second readout register (positions 22, 22&#39; in FIG. 3) in order to be able to also implement the TDI process in the opposite direction. FIG. 7 shows a block circuit diagram of the inventive apparatus and illustrates the relationship between the individual components. The apparatus controller 12 generates control signals for the detector arrangement 8, the diaphragm system 7 and X-ray source 3 and coordinates the execution (the motion) of the detector arrangement 8 and of the X-ray source 3 for each sub-image sequence according to the predetermined path in an exposure. The image data acquired during a sequence are stored in an intermediate memory 25. The apparatus controller 12 not only controls the X-ray source 3, the diaphragm system 7 and the detector arrangement 8 but also supplies exposure related radiation, position and path data to a software stage 26. The software stage 26 also processes the image data of the sub-images stored in the intermediate memory 25 that had been acquired with the detectors to a form a &#34;raw image&#34;. This &#34;raw image&#34; is subsequently processed in a further software stage 27 to form an X-ray image, which is subsequently stored in a data bank 28. From the data band 28, for example, the data (image) can be called via a PC and displayed on a monitor 30. Advantageously, the parameters necessary for an exposure can be generated by the PC 29 from the software stage 27, these being forwarded therefrom to the apparatus controller 12. The summation or integration needed for producing the tomograms can--as shown--ensue with the assistance of the CCDs that are operated in the TDI mode. The image thereby arises during the data acquisition on the basis of an &#34;analog&#34; summation within the active CCD area. Alternatively, the image acquisition is possible without the TDI method by acquiring an image of the complete sensor area and storing it for each motion increment according to the necessary sensor motion. The term &#34;full frame mode&#34; or &#34;area mode&#34; is usually employed for this operating mode. A more economical technology (for example, CMOS technology) can be used in this alternative instead of CCD technology.'.\n",

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] 1. Field of the Invention [0003] The present invention is directed to a syringe assembly having a collapsed plunger rod, and more particularly, to a syringe assembly having a collapsed plunger rod wherein the plunger rod has magnification properties to reduce medication errors. The present invention is also directed to a syringe assembly having a smaller packaging footprint allowing for reduced storage space. [0004] 2. Description of Related Art [0005] Syringe assemblies, and in particular hypodermic syringes, are well known in the medical field for dispensing fluids, such as medication. A conventional syringe typically includes a syringe barrel with an opening at one end and a plunger mechanism disposed through the other end. The plunger typically includes a plunger rod extending through the barrel, with a plunger head or stopper at the end of the plunger rod within the barrel and with a finger flange at the other end of the plunger rod extending out of the barrel. In use, the plunger rod is retracted through the syringe barrel to fill the syringe barrel with a fluid, such as a medication, with the plunger rod extending out from the rear end of the syringe barrel. For delivery of the medication to a patient, the opening of the syringe barrel is adapted for fluid communication with a patient, such as through a hypodermic needle fitted at the front end of the syringe barrel or through a luer-type fitting extending from the front end of the syringe barrel for attachment with a fluid line of a patient. Upon depression of the plunger rod, the plunger rod and stopper travel through the syringe barrel, thereby forcing the contents of the syringe out through the opening at the front end for delivery to the patient. Such an operation is well known in the medical field, and medical practitioners have become well accustomed to the use of such common fluid delivery procedures through standard syringes. [0006] Syringe assemblies having magnification members which are separately attached to the syringe barrel are also well known. U.S. Pat. No. 2,586,581 to Tschischeck discloses a magnifying attachment that fits around a syringe barrel. U.S. Pat. No. 4,178,071 to Asbell discloses a movable lens for viewing indicia lines that are visually accessible through a transparent region of a syringe body. The movable lens is carried by straps clasped to the exterior surface of tubing surrounding the syringe body. U.S. Pat. No. 4,743,234 to Leopoldi et al. discloses a syringe magnifier that is attached directly onto a syringe barrel. [0007] Conventional syringes are well known to be used in connection with a vial of a medication, where the user draws the fluid into the syringe immediately prior to injection and delivery of the fluid to the patient. Oftentimes, hypodermic syringes may be packaged as “pre-filled” devices, wherein the syringe is pre-filled with medication prior to being packaged and delivered to the end user. In this manner, there is no need for the user to fill the device prior to injection, thereby saving time for the end user and maintaining consistent volumes for delivery. [0008] Pre-filled syringes and pre-filled metered dose syringes are often filled with narcotics or other drugs at a production facility, packaged, and then shipped to a medical facility. Once at the facility, these syringes are often placed in controlled storage and/or locked cabinets to reduce theft of the syringes themselves and/or theft of the contents of these syringes. The space within these controlled storage locations is often limited, thus there is a need for a syringe assembly that has magnification properties wherein the magnification member is an integral component of the assembly such that the syringe assembly has a smaller packaging footprint to reduce the storage space required for containing this syringe. It is also desirable to produce syringes that are uniform in terms of an outer surface shape to allow for stacking of the syringes within the storage cabinet. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] According to a first aspect, the invention is directed to a syringe assembly having a collapsed plunger rod wherein the plunger rod has magnification properties. The syringe barrel has a proximal end, a distal end, and a sidewall extending between the proximal end and the distal end. A stopper is located within the syringe barrel and a stopper adapter associated with the stopper. The syringe barrel, stopper, and stopper adapter define a longitudinal axis. A plunger rod is secured to the adapter and is configured for cooperation with the adapter to move from a collapsed pre-use position, where the plunger rod extends substantially parallel with the barrel sidewall and is capable of magnifying indicia, such as content identifying indicia associated with the barrel sidewall, to an expanded ready-to-use position where the plunger rod extends substantially in line with the longitudinal axis of the syringe barrel, stopper, and the stopper adapter. The plunger rod includes a first end and a second end and an attachment member located at the second end. This attachment member on the plunger rod cooperates with the stopper adapter to secure the plunger rod thereto in the expanded ready-to-use position. The syringe assembly can further include a flange located at the proximal end of the syringe barrel. This flange includes an opening in alignment with an opening in the stopper adapter through which the plunger rod extends. A magnification member is associated with the plunger rod for magnifying any indicia associated with the syringe barrel. [0010] In operation, the plunger rod moves from the collapsed position to the expanded position through a pivoting motion of the second end of the plunger rod in a radial direction with respect to the syringe barrel, and through the application of a force to the plunger rod in a proximal direction toward the proximal end of the syringe barrel to axially slide the plunger rod through the openings in the flange and the stopper adapter to align the plunger rod along the longitudinal axis of the syringe barrel, stopper, and stopper adapter and to secure the attachment member on the second end of the plunger rod with the stopper adapter. The plunger rod can include a thumb press member located at the first end of the rod and is positioned above the proximal end of the syringe barrel and the flange. [0011] According to one embodiment, the plunger rod can include magnification properties for magnifying any indicia associated with and/or located on the syringe barrel. One modification to this embodiment can include a plunger rod having two or more legs and wherein at least one of these legs includes magnification properties. According to another embodiment, a sleeve can be fitted about the syringe barrel. This sleeve can include a magnification lens incorporated therein. [0012] According to another aspect, the invention is directed to a syringe assembly having magnification properties comprising a syringe barrel having a proximal end, a distal end, and a sidewall extending between the proximal end and the distal end. The sidewall can include indicia printed directly thereon or printed on a label secured to the sidewall. This indicia can include label information such as the drug name, concentration, expiration, and the like. The indicia can also include dosing information or barrel markings. A magnification member is associated with the plunger rod and the syringe barrel for magnifying this indicia. According to one embodiment, this magnification member comprises a collapsed plunger rod having at least a portion positioned adjacent the syringe barrel sidewall. According to one alternative design, the collapsed plunger rod can include two or more legs and at least one of the legs has magnification properties. According to an alternative embodiment, the magnification member can comprise a sleeve fitting about the syringe barrel wherein the sleeve includes a magnification lens incorporated therein. According to yet another alternative design, the plunger rod can be a pivoting plunger which pivots from a first position, in which the rod is adjacent to the syringe barrel, to a second position in which the plunger rod is in general axial alignment with the syringe barrel, and is further adapted for axial movement so as to cause the slidable movement of the plunger head through the syringe barrel. The pivoting plunger rod can include a tip guard integrally formed with a distal end thereof for protecting the distal end of the syringe assembly. The pivoting plunger can include a magnification member associated therewith for magnifying indicia associated with the syringe barrel.

[0035] With continuing reference to FIGS. 1-2 , a stopper 22 is located within the syringe barrel 14 and a stopper adapter 24 is associated with the stopper 22. The stopper adapter 24 may be integrally formed with the stopper 22 or may be a separately molded member having a first end secured to the stopper 22. The syringe barrel 14 , stopper 22 , and stopper adapter 24 define a longitudinal axis L, as shown in FIG. 1. The plunger rod 12 may be secured to the stopper adapter 24 and is configured for cooperation with the stopper adapter 24 to move from a collapsed pre-use position to an expanded ready-to-use position. In one embodiment, the plunger rod 12 is adapted to transition from the pre-use position in which the plunger rod 12 extends substantially parallel with the sidewall 20 of the syringe barrel 14 , to the expanded ready-to-use position in which the plunger rod 12 extends substantially in line with the longitudinal axis of the syringe barrel 14 , stopper 22 , and the stopper adapter 24. In one embodiment, the plunger rod 12 includes a first end 28 and a second end 30 with an attachment member 32 disposed adjacent the second end 30. The stopper adapter 24 may include a joining end 26 configured for connection with the attachment member 32 of the plunger rod 12 in the ready-to-use position. [0036] Reference is now made to FIGS. 2-4C which show the syringe assembly having a collapsible plunger rod including magnification properties according to another design of the invention. Like reference numerals are being used for like components of the FIG. 1 design. The syringe assembly 10 includes a containing member 37 adjacent a cut-out portion 46 or recessed groove in the proximal end 16 of the syringe barrel sidewall 20 , which is dimensioned to allow a portion of the plunger rod 12 to pass therethrough. The cut-out portion 46 may also be dimensioned such that the first end 28 and the second end 30 may not pass through the cut-out portion 46 and are restrained by the containing member 37 preventing inadvertent separation of the plunger rod 12 from the syringe assembly 10 in the initial pre-use position or during transition of the plunger rod 12 to the ready-to-use position. Outward or pivotal movement by a clinician in the direction of arrow A shown in FIG. 2 can dislodge the plunger rod 12 from the joining end 26 of the stopper adapter 24 for activation of the plunger rod 12 to the expanded ready-to-use state. During transition of the syringe assembly 10 from the initial position to the ready-to-use position, the plunger rod 12 is advanced in an angled substantially proximal direction as shown by arrow A of FIG. 3A. [0037] Reference is now made to FIGS. 3A-3C which shows sequential perspective views of the movement of the collapsed plunger rod 12 into the ready-to-use position. In operation, the plunger rod 12 moves from the collapsed position to the expanded position through a pivoting motion of the second end 30 of the plunger rod 12 , as shown in FIG. 3A , in a radial direction with respect to the syringe barrel 14. A subsequent application of a force to the plunger rod 12 in the proximal direction, as shown by arrow B of FIG. 3A causes the plunger rod 12 to slide in an axial direction toward the proximal end 16 of the syringe barrel 14. The syringe assembly 10 can further include a flange 40 located at the proximal end 16 of the syringe barrel 14. This flange 40 can include an opening 42 which is in alignment with an opening 44 in the stopper adapter 24 through which the plunger rod 12 extends. The cut-out portion 46 can be provided in the proximal end 16 of the syringe barrel sidewall 20 to facilitate movement of the attachment member 32 through the flange opening 42 and the stopper adapter opening 44. Openings 42 , 44 and cut-out portion 46 are best shown in FIG. 3B. The applied axial movement causes the plunger rod 12 to move through the flange opening 42 and the stopper adapter opening 44 to align the plunger rod 12 along the longitudinal axis of the syringe barrel 14 , stopper 22 , and stopper adapter 24.'.\n",

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] 1. Field of the Invention [0003] The present invention is directed to a syringe assembly having a collapsed plunger rod, and more particularly, to a syringe assembly having a collapsed plunger rod wherein the plunger rod has magnification properties to reduce medication errors. The present invention is also directed to a syringe assembly having a smaller packaging footprint allowing for reduced storage space. [0004] 2. Description of Related Art [0005] Syringe assemblies, and in particular hypodermic syringes, are well known in the medical field for dispensing fluids, such as medication. A conventional syringe typically includes a syringe barrel with an opening at one end and a plunger mechanism disposed through the other end. The plunger typically includes a plunger rod extending through the barrel, with a plunger head or stopper at the end of the plunger rod within the barrel and with a finger flange at the other end of the plunger rod extending out of the barrel. In use, the plunger rod is retracted through the syringe barrel to fill the syringe barrel with a fluid, such as a medication, with the plunger rod extending out from the rear end of the syringe barrel. For delivery of the medication to a patient, the opening of the syringe barrel is adapted for fluid communication with a patient, such as through a hypodermic needle fitted at the front end of the syringe barrel or through a luer-type fitting extending from the front end of the syringe barrel for attachment with a fluid line of a patient. Upon depression of the plunger rod, the plunger rod and stopper travel through the syringe barrel, thereby forcing the contents of the syringe out through the opening at the front end for delivery to the patient. Such an operation is well known in the medical field, and medical practitioners have become well accustomed to the use of such common fluid delivery procedures through standard syringes. [0006] Syringe assemblies having magnification members which are separately attached to the syringe barrel are also well known. U.S. Pat. No. 2,586,581 to Tschischeck discloses a magnifying attachment that fits around a syringe barrel. U.S. Pat. No. 4,178,071 to Asbell discloses a movable lens for viewing indicia lines that are visually accessible through a transparent region of a syringe body. The movable lens is carried by straps clasped to the exterior surface of tubing surrounding the syringe body. U.S. Pat. No. 4,743,234 to Leopoldi et al. discloses a syringe magnifier that is attached directly onto a syringe barrel. [0007] Conventional syringes are well known to be used in connection with a vial of a medication, where the user draws the fluid into the syringe immediately prior to injection and delivery of the fluid to the patient. Oftentimes, hypodermic syringes may be packaged as “pre-filled” devices, wherein the syringe is pre-filled with medication prior to being packaged and delivered to the end user. In this manner, there is no need for the user to fill the device prior to injection, thereby saving time for the end user and maintaining consistent volumes for delivery. [0008] Pre-filled syringes and pre-filled metered dose syringes are often filled with narcotics or other drugs at a production facility, packaged, and then shipped to a medical facility. Once at the facility, these syringes are often placed in controlled storage and/or locked cabinets to reduce theft of the syringes themselves and/or theft of the contents of these syringes. The space within these controlled storage locations is often limited, thus there is a need for a syringe assembly that has magnification properties wherein the magnification member is an integral component of the assembly such that the syringe assembly has a smaller packaging footprint to reduce the storage space required for containing this syringe. It is also desirable to produce syringes that are uniform in terms of an outer surface shape to allow for stacking of the syringes within the storage cabinet. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] According to a first aspect, the invention is directed to a syringe assembly having a collapsed plunger rod wherein the plunger rod has magnification properties. The syringe barrel has a proximal end, a distal end, and a sidewall extending between the proximal end and the distal end. A stopper is located within the syringe barrel and a stopper adapter associated with the stopper. The syringe barrel, stopper, and stopper adapter define a longitudinal axis. A plunger rod is secured to the adapter and is configured for cooperation with the adapter to move from a collapsed pre-use position, where the plunger rod extends substantially parallel with the barrel sidewall and is capable of magnifying indicia, such as content identifying indicia associated with the barrel sidewall, to an expanded ready-to-use position where the plunger rod extends substantially in line with the longitudinal axis of the syringe barrel, stopper, and the stopper adapter. The plunger rod includes a first end and a second end and an attachment member located at the second end. This attachment member on the plunger rod cooperates with the stopper adapter to secure the plunger rod thereto in the expanded ready-to-use position. The syringe assembly can further include a flange located at the proximal end of the syringe barrel. This flange includes an opening in alignment with an opening in the stopper adapter through which the plunger rod extends. A magnification member is associated with the plunger rod for magnifying any indicia associated with the syringe barrel. [0010] In operation, the plunger rod moves from the collapsed position to the expanded position through a pivoting motion of the second end of the plunger rod in a radial direction with respect to the syringe barrel, and through the application of a force to the plunger rod in a proximal direction toward the proximal end of the syringe barrel to axially slide the plunger rod through the openings in the flange and the stopper adapter to align the plunger rod along the longitudinal axis of the syringe barrel, stopper, and stopper adapter and to secure the attachment member on the second end of the plunger rod with the stopper adapter. The plunger rod can include a thumb press member located at the first end of the rod and is positioned above the proximal end of the syringe barrel and the flange. [0011] According to one embodiment, the plunger rod can include magnification properties for magnifying any indicia associated with and/or located on the syringe barrel. One modification to this embodiment can include a plunger rod having two or more legs and wherein at least one of these legs includes magnification properties. According to another embodiment, a sleeve can be fitted about the syringe barrel. This sleeve can include a magnification lens incorporated therein. [0012] According to another aspect, the invention is directed to a syringe assembly having magnification properties comprising a syringe barrel having a proximal end, a distal end, and a sidewall extending between the proximal end and the distal end. The sidewall can include indicia printed directly thereon or printed on a label secured to the sidewall. This indicia can include label information such as the drug name, concentration, expiration, and the like. The indicia can also include dosing information or barrel markings. A magnification member is associated with the plunger rod and the syringe barrel for magnifying this indicia. According to one embodiment, this magnification member comprises a collapsed plunger rod having at least a portion positioned adjacent the syringe barrel sidewall. According to one alternative design, the collapsed plunger rod can include two or more legs and at least one of the legs has magnification properties. According to an alternative embodiment, the magnification member can comprise a sleeve fitting about the syringe barrel wherein the sleeve includes a magnification lens incorporated therein. According to yet another alternative design, the plunger rod can be a pivoting plunger which pivots from a first position, in which the rod is adjacent to the syringe barrel, to a second position in which the plunger rod is in general axial alignment with the syringe barrel, and is further adapted for axial movement so as to cause the slidable movement of the plunger head through the syringe barrel. The pivoting plunger rod can include a tip guard integrally formed with a distal end thereof for protecting the distal end of the syringe assembly. The pivoting plunger can include a magnification member associated therewith for magnifying indicia associated with the syringe barrel.

[0035] With continuing reference to FIGS. 1-2 , a stopper 22 is located within the syringe barrel 14 and a stopper adapter 24 is associated with the stopper 22. The stopper adapter 24 may be integrally formed with the stopper 22 or may be a separately molded member having a first end secured to the stopper 22.

The plunger rod 12 may be secured to the stopper adapter 24 and is configured for cooperation with the stopper adapter 24 to move from a collapsed pre-use position to an expanded ready-to-use position. In one embodiment, the plunger rod 12 is adapted to transition from the pre-use position in which the plunger rod 12 extends substantially parallel with the sidewall 20 of the syringe barrel 14 , to the expanded ready-to-use position in which the plunger rod 12 extends substantially in line with the longitudinal axis of the syringe barrel 14 , stopper 22 , and the stopper adapter 24. In one embodiment, the plunger rod 12 includes a first end 28 and a second end 30 with an attachment member 32 disposed adjacent the second end 30.

      "Changed 'agent' by 'opening' in '[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/888,926, filed Feb. 8, 2007; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD [0002] This invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations, particularly aqueous nasal preparations, of an antihistamine compound, such as epinastine hydrochloride and related compounds. This invention also relates to methods of treating allergic rhinitis by intranasal delivery of a small volume of a viscous epinastine formulation, whereby the patient perceives a minimal or no bitter taste of epinastine. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Epinastine, chemically known as 3-amino-9,13b-dihydro-1H-dibenz-[c,-f]imidazol[1,5-a]azepine, and its acid addition salts are disclosed in German Patent application P 30 08 944.2 which forms the basis for EP 0035749. Methods for the preparation of epinastine are described in EP 0496306 or WO 01/40229. Epinastine is most often used for its antihistaminic effects. [0004] Epinastine hydrochloride (ELASTAT®) has been approved as an eye drop in U.S. for treating allergic conjunctivitis. Epinastine hydrochloride has been approved as an oral tablet in Japan and some South American countries for treating allergic rhinitis. However, especially for children and elderly people, tablets are not always easy to take. It is found that aqueous formulations of epinastine-hydrochloride result in bad taste, reported as bitterness or bitter aftertaste. The bitter taste of epinastine is strong and could not be masked by the use of a single conventional taste-masking agent such as sucrose. [0005] ASTELIN® (0.1% azelastine hydrochloride) nasal spray was approved for treating allergic rhinitis in the United States. When ASTELIN® was administered to subjects at 137 μL per spray, two sprays per nostril, twice daily, 19.7% of subjects reported adverse effects of bitter taste (see product package insert of ASTELIN® nasal spray). [0006] US2003/0104017 discloses a pharmaceutical formulation comprising epinastine or an acid addition salt thereof, and at least two kinds of sweeteners or flavoring agents, wherein one of the at least two kinds of sweeteners or flavoring agents masks the quick-acting bitterness of epinastine or its salt and the other one masks the long-acting bitterness of epinastine or its salt. [0007] WO2004/075900 discloses pharmaceutical powder formulation comprising epinastine, sodium lauryl sulfate, sweetening agents and/or flavoring agents. [0008] US2003/0050303 discloses a method for inhibiting the influx of neutrophils and eosinophils into the tissue of the ocular conjunctiva or the nasal mucous membrane in a host, the method comprising topically administering to a host in need of such treatment an aqueous solution comprising epinastine, optionally in the form of its racemate, its enantiomers, or its pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, in a concentration of 0.005 to 0.5 mg/ml of solution. [0009] US2002/037297 discloses a process for the topical treatment of or prophylaxis against allergic rhinitis, vasomotoric rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cold, cold-like and/or flu symptoms. The method comprises topically administering to mucous tissues of a patient in need therefor a non-sedating antihistamine and an α-adrenergic agonist. [0010] US2006/0110331 discloses a composition comprising azelastine, hypromellose as a viscosity modifier and sucralose as a taste-masking agent. [0011] Currently, there is not an effective method for treating allergic rhinitis with an aqueous intranasal spray formulation without causing strong and unpleasant bitter taste associated with post-nasal drip. There is a need for an improved aqueous nasal spray formulation for treating allergic rhinitis; such aqueous nasal spray formulation is not only effective to treat allergic rhinitis but also has an acceptable taste profile following repeated dosing. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0012] The present invention is directed to an aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprising epinastine or an acid addition salt thereof, and a viscosity-enhancing agent. The viscosity-enhancing agent provides an enhanced viscosity of the formulation without causing precipitation of the active ingredient epinastine or other ingredients. The increased viscosity of the formulation minimizes post-nasal drip and reduces the possibility of the formulation to ‘drip back’ from the nasal cavity to the back of the throat. By minimizing the postnasal drip, the bitter taste of epinastine is less perceived by the subject. The viscosity-enhancing agent is a polymer selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvivnyl pyrrolidone, and the combination thereof. [0013] The aqueous pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention typically comprises 0.05-0.2% (w/v) epinastine or an acid addition salt thereof, 0.05-0.5% (w/v) viscosity-enhancing agent, a buffer to maintain a pH between 5-8, and a tonicity agent to maintain a tonicity between 200-400 mOsm/kG. [0014] The present invention also provides a method for treating allergic rhinitis in a subject. The method comprises the steps of: identifying a subject suffering from allergic rhinitis; administering to the nose of the subject one to two sprays at ≦115 μL per nostril per spray once or twice daily of an aqueous epinastine formulation; wherein said aqueous epinastine formulation comprises (a) 0.05-0.2% (w/v) of epinastine or an acid addition salt thereof, (b) 0.05-0.5% (w/v) of a viscosity-enhancing agent selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the combination thereof, to maintain the viscosity between 1.5-10 centipoise, and (c) a tonicity agent to maintain a tonicity between 200-400 mOsm/kG; whereby the subject perceives a minimal or no bitter taste of said epinastine and the symptoms of allergic rhinitis are reduced. A preferred viscosity-enhancing agent is hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. A preferred tonicy agent is propylene glycol. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0015] The inventor has unexpectedly discovered an aqueous epinastine formulation that can be delivered topically for use in the nose or in the eye and has a minimal or no bitter taste. The aqueous epinastine formulation is viscous and has a viscosity of 1.5-10 centipoises. When intranasally delievered in a small volume of ≦120 μL, preferably ≦115 μL, preferably ≦100 μL, preferably ≦90 μL, more preferably ≦85 μL per nostril per spray, the epinastine formulation of the present invention is effective in treating allergic rhinitis, and does not cause a strong bitter aftertaste, even without including taste-masking agents such as sweeteners or flavoring agents in the formulation. Although the nose has a large space relative to the spray volume emitted by a small volume metered-dose nasal spray pump, the inventor has unexpectedly discovered that reducing the nasal spray volume from 137 μL (ASTELIN® nasal spray volume) to ≦115 μL, preferably to &lt;85 μL, plays an important role in minimizing the bitter aftertaste of epinastine. The inventor has discovered that delivering a small volume of the viscous epinastine formulation of the present invention reduces the bitter aftertaste significantly without compromising the therapeutic efficacy of epinastine. The viscous epinastine formulation is delivered to the nose of a patient using a metered-dose nasal spray pump. The viscous epinastine formulation has minimal post-nasal drip and does not cause an unacceptable quick-acting bitterness or a long-acting bitterness after dosing. [0016] This invention is directed to an aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprising an antihistamine chemical compound such as epinastine and salts thereof. This invention provides a formulation containing one or more viscosity-enhancing agents that increase the viscosity of the formulation and minimize the bitter taste of epinastine. The formulation does not contain a substantial amount of unacceptable agents for pharmaceutical, particularly, ophthalmic and nasal use. The invention provides a stable aqueous formulation of epinastine; the formulation is suitable for therapeutic uses and remains stable under normal use storage conditions for an extended period of time. [0017] The aqueous pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention exclude the use of inappropriate adjuvants that can cause toxicological outcomes and tissue damage when used in humans or mammals for a long term. The aqueous pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention contain epinastine in solution at sufficient concentrations, and provide an anti-allergic response in mammals. The aqueous pharmaceutical formulations are non-irritating and tolerable to human epithelial cells, and are suitable for multiple instillations. [0018] The present invention is directed to an aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprising epinastine or a salt thereof, and a viscosity-enhancing agent. Epinastine can be used either as free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Preferably, epinastine is used in the form of its acid addition salts such as hydrochloride salt. [0019] “A viscosity-enhancing agent,” as used herein, refers to a compound when added to a solution increases the viscosity of the solution. A viscosity-enhancing agent at a suitable concentration can modify or alter the flow properties of the system from a Newtonian fashion (e.g. water) to a pseudo plastic or plastic flow. An increased viscosity alters the residence time, drainage characteristics, and/or bioavailability of the pharmaceutical formulation. A viscosity-enhancing agent typically increases the viscosity of the pharmaceutical formulation 1.5-10 fold (e.g. 1.5-10 centipoises) with respect to water (approximately 1 centipoise). [0020] The viscosity-enhancing agent used in the formulation provides an enhanced viscosity of the formulation without causing precipitation of the active ingredient epinastine or other ingredients. Furthermore, the viscosity-enhancing agent is compatible with other agents in the formulation. The increased viscosity of the formulation provides a sustained action, minimizes post-nasal drip, and reduces the possibility of the formulation to ‘drip back’ from the nasal cavity to the back of the throat. By minimizing the postnasal drip, the bitter taste of epinastine is less perceived by the subject. [0021] A viscosity-enhancing agent useful for the present invention is often a polymer such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvivnyl pyrrolidone. A preferred viscosity-enhancing agent is hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. The viscosity-enhancing agent often improves the physical stability of the formulation. The inventor has discovered that not all typical pharmaceutically acceptable viscosity modifiers are suitable for use in this invention because they are physically incompatible with epinastine in solution and result in flocculation and phase separation, and/or they do not function well at pH 4-8. For example, polyvinyl acrylic acid, polystyrene sulfonic acid, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan gum, microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose are not suitable for this invention. [0022] Typically, the aqueous pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention comprises 0.001-3% (w/v) epinastine or an acid addition salt thereof, 0.001-0.5% (w/v) viscosity-enhancing agent, a buffer to maintain a pH between 4-8, and a tonicity agent to maintain a tonicity between 200-400 mOsm/kG. The viscosity of the formulation is about 1.5-10 centipoises (cps), preferably 1.5-10 cps, more preferably 2-9 cps, and more preferably 2-6 cps. [0023] The concentration of epinastine in the aqueous formulation is in general 0.001-3%, preferably 0.005-1% or 0.005-0.6%, and more preferably 0.05-0.2% or 0.1-0.15% (w/v). For example, a preferred concentration of epinastine is about 0.1% or about 0.15%. [0024] As used in this application, “about” refers to ±15% of the value recited. [0025] The concentration of a viscosity-enhancing agent in the aqueous formulation is in general 0.001-5%, preferably 0.05-0.5%, and more preferably 0.1-0.3% (w/v). [0026] The pH of the present formulation is 4-8, preferably 5-8, more preferably 6.0-7.5. Buffers suitable to maintain the pH between 4-8 include phosphate, citrate buffer, acetate buffer, maleate buffer, tartarate buffer, or combination thereof. Phosphate buffer or citrate buffer is preferred. For long-term stability, the formulation is preferred to have a pH of 5-8. Buffers suitable to maintain the pH of 5-8 include citrate buffer, phosphate buffer, citrate/phosphate buffer, maleate buffer, tartarate buffer, or combination thereof. A suitable concentration of the buffer is 1-100 mM, preferably 5-50 mM, more preferably 5-25 mM, and most preferably 10-20 mM. [0027] The tonicity agent is present in an amount to achieve a tonicity between 200-400, preferably 220-380, and more preferably 250-340 mOsm/kG. The tonicity agent can be non-ionic or ionic. A non-ionic tonicity agent is preferred because its compatibility with polymeric adjuvant that functions as a viscosity-enhancing agent. Non-ionic tonicity agents include diols, such as glycerol, mannitol, erythritol; and sugars such as sucrose and dextrose. Other non-ionic tonicity agents such as glycerol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, which also function as cosolvents and taste-masking agent, can also be used. The non-ionic tonicity agent is in general in an amount of 1-20%, preferably 1-10%, more preferably 1-5%. Preferred non-ionic agents are mannitol, sucrose, dextrose, propylene glycol, in an amount of 1-5%. For Example, propylene glycol at 1-2% or 1-1.8% (w/v) is a preferred non-ionic tonicity agent for the present invention. [0028] The tonicity agent can also be ionic agents such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, or a balanced salt solution. The ionic tonicity agents are typically present in an amount of 0.5-0.9%, preferably 0.6-0.9%. [0029] The pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention optionally comprises a chelating agent. A chelating agent is a substance which can form several coordinate bonds to a metal ion. Chelating agents offers a wide range of sequestrants to control metal ions in aqueous systems. By forming stable water-soluble complexes with multivalent metal ions, chelating agents prevent undesired interaction by blocking normal reactivity of metal ions. Ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and N,N-bis(carboxymethyl)glycine (NTA) are examples of chelating agents for the present inventions. EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetate) is a preferred chelating agent. The chelating agents are typically present in an amount of 0.01-1%, and preferably 0.02-0.5% w/v. [0030] Health regulations in various countries require that multi-dose ophthalmic and nasal preparations include a preservative. The pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention optionally comprises a preservative. Many well known preservatives that have been used in some other nasal and ophthalmic preparations cannot be used in the present invention, since those preservatives are not considered safe for repeatedly ocular use, or they interact with the viscosity-enhancing agent employed herein to form a complex that reduces the bactericidal activity of the preservative. Suitable preservatives for the present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, methyl parabens, propyl parabens, and benzethonium chlorides. In one embodiment, benzalkonium chloride is included as a safe preservative; preferably, benzalkonium chloride is used with EDTA. Typically, preservatives are employed at a level of 0.001-1%, preferably, 0.005-0.25%, and most preferably 0.05-0.2% (w/v). [0031] The pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention optionally comprises one or more taste-masking agents to mask the bitter taste of epinastine. Taste-masking agents can be sweeteners, flavoring agents, or other agents that can mask the taste of a formulation. Taste-masking agents suitable for the present invention include saccharin sodium, erythritol, aspartame, sucrose, glycerin, sorbitol, glycyrrhinic acid, or glycyrrihinate ammonium salts. A good taste-masking agent is glycyrrihinate ammonium salts. Commercially available SWEETAM™ flavor (Flavors of North America), which contains monoammonium glycyrrihinate salts pre-blended with suitable adjuvants such as sucrose and dextrose, is also suitable to be included in the present formulation. A taste-masking agent at a level of 0.001-0.5% (w/v) can be included in the fonnulation. However, the inventor has discovered that the aqueous epinastine formulation of the present invention does not cause bitter aftertaste even without including a taste-masking agent such as sweeteners or flavoring agents. [0032] The viscosity-enhancing agent, the tonicity agent, the buffer, the taste-masking agent, and any other ingredient introduced in the formulation must have a good solubility in water, have compatibility with other components, and have mild effects on the final viscosity of the formulation. This viscosity of the formulation is important such that the formulation can be delivered as a topical nasal spray using a metered-dose nasal spray device and is filter-sterilizable. The formulation is preferably a clear solution without any precipitate. [0033] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation comprises epinastine or its salts in an amount of 0.05-0.2% (w/v), a non-ionic tonicity agent such as propylene glycol at 1.0-1.8% (w/v), a buffer (such as sodium phosphates) at 10-25 mM, a viscosity-enhancing agent in a range of 0.05-0.5% (w/v), an optional chelating agent in a range of 0.02-0.5% (w/v), and an optional preservative in a range of 0.005-0.2% (w/v). Such an aqueous composition has a tonicity of 250-350 mOsm/kG and is formulated at pH 5-8. [0034] In another embodiment, an aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprises epinastine or its salts in an amount of 0.001-3% (w/v), 1-100 mM buffer suitable to maintain the pH between 5-8, 0.001-0.5% (w/v) viscosity-enhancing agent to maintain a viscosity of 1.5-10 cps, a tonicity agent to maintain a tonicity between 200-400 mOsm/kG, and a taste-masking agent at a level of 0.001-5% w/v. The formulation optionally comprises a preservative (such as benzalkonium chloride) at a level of 0.005-0.2% w/v. [0035] The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention are preferably stable at room temperature for at least 12 months, preferably 24 months, and more preferably 36 months. Stable, as used herein, means that epinastine maintains at least 80%, preferably 85%, 90%, or 95% of its initial activity. [0036] The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention can be prepared by aseptic technique or are terminally sterilized. The purity levels of all materials used in the preparation exceed 90%. The solutions of the invention are prepared by thoroughly mixing the epinastine or salts thereof, buffer(s), tonicity agent(s), viscosity-enhancing agent(s), optionally, taste-masking agent(s), chelating agent(s), complexing agent(s), solubilizing agent(s), preservative(s) and antioxidant agent(s). Examples of complexing agents are cyclodextrins, gamma-cyclodextrin, and crosspovidone. Examples of solubilizing agents are polysorbates, crernophor, and glycerin. Examples of antioxidants are tocopherol, butylated hydroxytoulene, butylated hydroxyanisole. Complexing agents, solubilizing agents, antioxidants can be added to the formulation; however, they are not essential for the formulation of the present invention. [0037] The pharmaceutical formulation can be sterilized by filtering the formulation through a sterilizing grade filter, preferably of a 0.1 micron nominal pore size. The pharmaceutical formulation can also be sterilized by terminally sterilization using one or more sterilization techniques including but not limited to a thermal process, or a radiation sterilization process, or using pulsed light to produce a sterile formulation. [0038] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention is administered locally to the eye (e.g., topically, intracamerally, or via an implant) in the form of ophthalmic preparations. The pharmaceutical formulation can be combined with additional ophthalmologically acceptable viscosity enhancers, or penetration enhancers to form an ophthalmic suspension or solution. The pharmaceutical formulation is ready for use, without further dilution or any other manipulation. The pharmaceutical formulation can be administered to the eyes of a patient topically by any suitable means, but is preferably administered in the form of drops, spray or gel. For topical ophthalmic administration, one to two drops of the formulation are delivered to the surface of the eye one to three times per day according to the routine discretion of a skilled clinician.'.\n",

STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002] Not Applicable BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] 1. Field of the Invention [0004] The present invention relates to a variable length shaft assembly that allows for quick, semi-permanent length adjustments. More specifically, the present invention relates to a variable length shaft whose length can be adjusted in a short period of time with the use of shaft components having different lengths. [0005] 2. Description of The Related Art [0006] Customization of golf clubs to help golfers attain better shots has become a popular and more prevalent practice in recent years. Golf club manufacturers and designers have devised various features to allow club fitters and golf club players to adjust certain characteristics of their clubs. Such characteristics include loft, lie, face angle, center of gravity (CG) location, and club length. [0007] Current technology provides two methods to adjust overall club length. One such method involves the destruction and removal of the grip on a shaft. Upon removal of the grip by peeling or tearing, the end portion of the shaft is trimmed to decrease the club length or an extension piece is affixed to the end of the shaft to increase its length. Aftermarket extensions are available specifically for this purpose; alternatively, extensions can be made from portions of other golf club shafts that are cut to the desired length and then inserted into the end of the first club&#39;s shaft. The extension piece must match the diameter of the existing shaft, so it is necessary at times to build up the diameter of the extension or existing shaft by adding layers of tape. This method requires that the user making the adjustments have access to potentially expensive new components and tools as well as having a high level of skill. It also causes damage to the original shaft and grip. [0008] The second method of adjusting club length involves replacing the entire shaft and grip using a semi-permanent head-shaft connection device that some manufacturers offer with their clubs, particularly with drivers. The existing shaft may be removed from the driver head and replaced with a different shaft that has either a shorter or longer length. This method is not possible on all clubs, however, as the head must have hardware that allows for removal of the shaft and replacement with a new shaft without damaging the head. [0009] A golfer who does not possess club altering skills or the necessary disposable income to purchase new components likely will be daunted by these two methods of adjusting club length. The first method requires the golfer to make use of several tools to remove the grip and cut the shaft if he or she desires a shorter length, and also to have materials such as tape and a replacement grip on hand to replace the grip and mend any damage caused to the shaft and grip. The skill set required to change the shaft length using this method is usually beyond the abilities of the average golfer, so the golfer would need to seek the services of a golf club fitter or technician to have their club length changed. The second method requires the golfer to buy an entirely new shaft at a different length, which can be very expensive, and also may require the golfer to retain a golf club fitter or technician to replace the shaft. [0010] Ultimately, the two methods described above require an inventory of spare components and above average technical skill, particularly with regard to the first method. It is therefore desirable to facilitate the change of a club&#39;s length using a faster, easier, and less expensive system and method than is currently available. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0011] One aspect of the present invention is a variable length golf club shaft comprising a grip assembly comprising a grip and an upper shaft portion, a lower shaft portion, and a semi-permanent fastener, wherein no portion of the grip is located on the lower shaft portion, and wherein the semi-permanent fastener removably connects the grip assembly to the lower shaft portion. The semi-permanent fastener may be a screw, and the lower shaft portion may comprise a hosel connection portion. The semi-permanent fastener may removably connect the grip assembly to the lower shaft portion along an axis located above the hosel connection portion and below the grip, and the axis may be located no less than 11 inches and no more than 18 inches from a butt end of the grip assembly. [0012] This aspect of the present invention may further comprise an upper adapter affixed to a lower, interior surface of the upper shaft portion, and a lower adapter affixed to an upper, interior surface of the lower shaft portion, wherein each of the upper and lower adapters comprises a bore, and wherein the semi permanent fastener is insertable through the bores of the upper and lower adapters.

The fastener captivator may be permanently attached to the upper adapter. An exterior portion of the lower adapter may comprise splines, and an interior portion of the upper adapter may also comprises splines, such that the splines on the exterior portion mate with the splines on the interior portion when the semi-permanent fastener connects the grip assembly to the lower shaft portion. [0013] The upper and lower shaft portions of the present invention may be composed of a material selected from the group consisting of aluminum, aluminum alloy, titanium, titanium alloy, steel, magnesium, magnesium alloy, plastic, and graphite composite. The upper and lower adapters of the present invention may also be composed of a material selected from the group consisting of aluminum, aluminum alloy, titanium, titanium alloy, steel, magnesium, magnesium alloy, plastic, and graphite composite. [0014] This aspect of the present invention may further comprise an upper o-ring disposed proximate the upper adapter and a lower o-ring disposed proximate the lower adapter. The invention may also further comprise at least two upper shaft portions, wherein the at least two upper shaft portions have different lengths. The at least two upper shaft portions may, for example, differ in length from each other by no less than 0.5 inch. The at least two upper shaft portions may differ in weight from each other, or may have the same weight. [0015] Another aspect of the present invention is a kit comprising at least two grip assemblies, a lower shaft portion, a threaded fastener, and a tool, wherein each grip assembly comprises an upper shaft portion and a grip, wherein no grip is disposed on the lower shaft portion, wherein the at least two grip assemblies have different lengths, wherein the tool engages the threaded fastener to tighten or loosen the threaded fastener, and wherein the threaded fastener removably connects the lower shaft portion with the at least two grip assemblies.

[0037] FIG. 15 is a side view of different lengths of grip assemblies of the embodiment shown in FIG. 10. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0038] The present invention is directed to a variable length shaft that provides club length adjustability. Club length adjustability is an advantageous feature for golf clubs because, for example, extending the length of a club can have the desired effect of increasing club head. speed, which results in longer driving distances. Conversely, shortening the length of a club would provide a golfer with more control and accuracy in driving the golf ball. Golf course conditions often require accurate driving due to hazards, including but not limited to water, rough, and out of bounds markers, and driving accuracy can be more preferred than driving distance in competitive situations. [0039] The present invention is also valuable because a golfer&#39;s swing may change over time, thus requiring alterations to his or her clubs. A golfer may improve his or her game through lessons and may gain greater flexibility and strength through practice and exercise. As such, it is reasonable for a golfer to wish to change his or her club&#39;s length to help improve his or her accuracy, distance, and feel as needed or desired. [0040] The present invention provides golfers with a system and method to easily, quickly and inexpensively modify the length of their golf clubs to have them perform in a desired manner. This invention will enable golfers to change their club length wherever they wish, including, but not limited to, at the practice range, the golf course, and their home. The present invention also is designed to avoid altering a club&#39;s swing weight or its “feel.” The tool and components that are used to alter a club&#39;s length are small and can be carried in a pocket of the user&#39;s golf bag. Furthermore, the technical ability required to modify the golf club length according to this invention is minimal and its approach is intuitive and easy for a golfer to understand. [0041] A first embodiment of the present variable length shaft invention is shown in FIGS. 1-4. According to this embodiment of the invention, and as shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 , two sections of the shaft 10 , the lower shaft and grip section 20 and the upper shaft and grip section 30 , are joined together proximate the upper end 25 and lower end 35 of the shaft portions 24 , 34 , respectively, along a demarcation line 200 , the line at which the two shaft and grip sections 20 , 30 meet. [0042] As shown in FIGS. 1 , 3 , and 4 , the lower shaft and grip section 20 includes a lower grip portion 22 that encircles and is affixed to a lower part of the shaft 24 with double-sided adhesive tape (not shown). In other embodiments, the lower grip portion 22 may be affixed to the shaft 24 with another type of adhesive material. A lower adapter 40 is affixed to or otherwise situated proximate the upper, interior surface of the lower part of the shaft 24 , and a lower-adapter o-ring 80 may be used to seal or otherwise secure the connection between the lower adapter 40 and the interior surface of the lower part of the shaft 24 , as shown in FIG. 4. The lower adapter 40 also contacts an interior surface of the lower grip portion 22 in the first embodiment of the present invention, also as shown in FIG. 4. This adapter 40 includes a threaded hole 45 in its center to receive a screw 50 that allows the adapter 40 to be fastened to the upper shaft and grip section 30. [0043] The upper shaft and grip section 30 correspondingly as an upper grip portion 32 encircling and affixed to an upper shaft portion 34 with double-sided adhesive tape (not shown), or, in other embodiments, another kind of adhesive material. The upper shaft and grip section 30 has an upper adapter 60 affixed to or otherwise situated proximate the lower, interior surface of the upper shaft portion 34 , and an upper-adapter o-ring 90 may be used to seal the connection between the upper adapter 60 and the upper shaft portion 34. The upper adapter 60 also contacts an interior surface of the upper grip portion 32 in the first embodiment of the present invention, which is also on shown in FIG. 4. The upper adapter 60 has a hole 65 , which in the first embodiment is not threaded, in its center to receive the screw 50 that mates with the lower adapter 40 associated with the lower shaft and grip section 20 , and is affixed to a screw captivator 70 that prevents the screw 50 from falling out of or otherwise becoming dislodged from the upper adapter 60. In another embodiment, the hole 65 can be threaded. [0044] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 , assembly of the first embodiment of the invention requires that the lower shaft and grip section 20 and the upper shaft and grip section 30 be aligned and pressed together in their proper orientation at a demarcation line 200 , the line where the two parts connect. The screw 50 located in the upper adapter 60 is threaded into the threaded hole 45 of the lower adapter 40 and tightened with a specifically provided tool 100 , as shown in FIGS. 7A , 7 B, 8 A, and 8 B. The adapters 40 , 60 may further include anti-rotational features to restrict twisting along the shaft axis when they are screwed together. When the screw 50 has been secured, the two shaft and grip sections 20 , 30 are interlocked securely together, thus allowing the club to be used to hit golf balls. This operation allows for a semi-permanent assembly that will make the golf club comply with the appropriate USGA rules of golf. [0045] In a second embodiment, shown in FIGS. 5A and 58 , the upper grip portion 32 and the lower grip portion 22 include a lip or collar 33 , 23. The upper grip portion 32 collar 33 is located at a single opening of the upper grip portion 32 , and the lower grip portion 22 collar 23 is located at an upper opening in the lower grip portion 22. When the upper grip portion 32 contacts the lower grip portion 22 with their respective adapters 60 , 40 installed, as shown in FIG. 5A , the collars 33 , 23 ensure a good fit between the upper and lower grip portions 32 , 22 and consistent grip length during the gripping operation. The collars 33 , 23 also help retain the adapters 60 , 40 within the upper and lower grip portions 32 , 22. By interfacing at a plane 17 normal to the shaft 10 axis 15 , as shown in FIG. 5A , the collars 33 , 23 provide greater contact between the upper and lower grip portions 32 , 22 , than in upper and lower grip portions that do not include collars 33 , 23. [0046] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5B , the collar 33 of the upper grip portion 32 preferably includes one or more slits 33 a - 33 d. These slits 33 a - 33 d can expedite production of upper grip portions 32 having different lengths, as the inclusion of a collar 33 may make it difficult to remove a core bar used to mold the inner diameter of the upper grip portions 32. The slits 33 a - 33 d thus allow for easier removal of the core bar from the upper grip portions 32 after molding is complete.'.\n",

[0037] FIG. 15 is a side view of different lengths of grip assemblies of the embodiment shown in FIG. 10. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0038] The present invention is directed to a variable length shaft that provides club length adjustability. Club length adjustability is an advantageous feature for golf clubs because, for example, extending the length of a club can have the desired effect of increasing club head. speed, which results in longer driving distances. Conversely, shortening the length of a club would provide a golfer with more control and accuracy in driving the golf ball. Golf course conditions often require accurate driving due to hazards, including but not limited to water, rough, and out of bounds markers, and driving accuracy can be more preferred than driving distance in competitive situations. [0039] The present invention is also valuable because a golfer&#39;s swing may change over time, thus requiring alterations to his or her clubs. A golfer may improve his or her game through lessons and may gain greater flexibility and strength through practice and exercise. As such, it is reasonable for a golfer to wish to change his or her club&#39;s length to help improve his or her accuracy, distance, and feel as needed or desired. [0040] The present invention provides golfers with a system and method to easily, quickly and inexpensively modify the length of their golf clubs to have them perform in a desired manner. This invention will enable golfers to change their club length wherever they wish, including, but not limited to, at the practice range, the golf course, and their home. The present invention also is designed to avoid altering a club&#39;s swing weight or its “feel.” The tool and components that are used to alter a club&#39;s length are small and can be carried in a pocket of the user&#39;s golf bag. Furthermore, the technical ability required to modify the golf club length according to this invention is minimal and its approach is intuitive and easy for a golfer to understand. [0041] A first embodiment of the present variable length shaft invention is shown in FIGS. 1-4. According to this embodiment of the invention, and as shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 , two sections of the shaft 10 , the lower shaft and grip section 20 and the upper shaft and grip section 30 , are joined together proximate the upper end 25 and lower end 35 of the shaft portions 24 , 34 , respectively, along a demarcation line 200 , the line at which the two shaft and grip sections 20 , 30 meet. [0042] As shown in FIGS. 1 , 3 , and 4 , the lower shaft and grip section 20 includes a lower grip portion 22 that encircles and is affixed to a lower part of the shaft 24 with double-sided adhesive tape (not shown). In other embodiments, the lower grip portion 22 may be affixed to the shaft 24 with another type of adhesive material. A lower adapter 40 is affixed to or otherwise situated proximate the upper, interior surface of the lower part of the shaft 24 , and a lower-adapter o-ring 80 may be used to seal or otherwise secure the connection between the lower adapter 40 and the interior surface of the lower part of the shaft 24 , as shown in FIG. 4. The lower adapter 40 also contacts an interior surface of the lower grip portion 22 in the first embodiment of the present invention, also as shown in FIG. 4. This adapter 40 includes a threaded hole 45 in its center to receive a screw 50 that allows the adapter 40 to be fastened to the upper shaft and grip section 30. [0043] The upper shaft and grip section 30 correspondingly as an upper grip portion 32 encircling and affixed to an upper shaft portion 34 with double-sided adhesive tape (not shown), or, in other embodiments, another kind of adhesive material. The upper shaft and grip section 30 has an upper adapter 60 affixed to or otherwise situated proximate the lower, interior surface of the upper shaft portion 34 , and an upper-adapter o-ring 90 may be used to seal the connection between the upper adapter 60 and the upper shaft portion 34. The upper adapter 60 also contacts an interior surface of the upper grip portion 32 in the first embodiment of the present invention, which is also on shown in FIG. 4. The upper adapter 60 has a hole 65 , which in the first embodiment is not threaded, in its center to receive the screw 50 that mates with the lower adapter 40 associated with the lower shaft and grip section 20 , and is affixed to a screw captivator 70 that prevents the screw 50 from falling out of or otherwise becoming dislodged from the upper adapter 60. In another embodiment, the hole 65 can be threaded. [0044] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 , assembly of the first embodiment of the invention requires that the lower shaft and grip section 20 and the upper shaft and grip section 30 be aligned and pressed together in their proper orientation at a demarcation line 200 , the line where the two parts connect. The screw 50 located in the upper adapter 60 is threaded into the threaded hole 45 of the lower adapter 40 and tightened with a specifically provided tool 100 , as shown in FIGS. 7A , 7 B, 8 A, and 8 B. The adapters 40 , 60 may further include anti-rotational features to restrict twisting along the shaft axis when they are screwed together. When the screw 50 has been secured, the two shaft and grip sections 20 , 30 are interlocked securely together, thus allowing the club to be used to hit golf balls. This operation allows for a semi-permanent assembly that will make the golf club comply with the appropriate USGA rules of golf. [0045] In a second embodiment, shown in FIGS. 5A and 58 , the upper grip portion 32 and the lower grip portion 22 include a lip or collar 33 , 23. The upper grip portion 32 collar 33 is located at a single opening of the upper grip portion 32 , and the lower grip portion 22 collar 23 is located at an upper opening in the lower grip portion 22. When the upper grip portion 32 contacts the lower grip portion 22 with their respective adapters 60 , 40 installed, as shown in FIG. 5A , the collars 33 , 23 ensure a good fit between the upper and lower grip portions 32 , 22 and consistent grip length during the gripping operation. The collars 33 , 23 also help retain the adapters 60 , 40 within the upper and lower grip portions 32 , 22. By interfacing at a plane 17 normal to the shaft 10 axis 15 , as shown in FIG. 5A , the collars 33 , 23 provide greater contact between the upper and lower grip portions 32 , 22 , than in upper and lower grip portions that do not include collars 33 , 23. [0046] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5B , the collar 33 of the upper grip portion 32 preferably includes one or more slits 33 a - 33 d. These slits 33 a - 33 d can expedite production of upper grip portions 32 having different lengths, as the inclusion of a collar 33 may make it difficult to remove a core bar used to mold the inner diameter of the upper grip portions 32. The slits 33 a - 33 d thus allow for easier removal of the core bar from the upper grip portions 32 after molding is complete.'.\n",

STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002] Not Applicable BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] 1. Field of the Invention [0004] The present invention relates to a variable length shaft assembly that allows for quick, semi-permanent length adjustments. More specifically, the present invention relates to a variable length shaft whose length can be adjusted in a short period of time with the use of shaft components having different lengths. [0005] 2. Description of The Related Art [0006] Customization of golf clubs to help golfers attain better shots has become a popular and more prevalent practice in recent years. Golf club manufacturers and designers have devised various features to allow club fitters and golf club players to adjust certain characteristics of their clubs. Such characteristics include loft, lie, face angle, center of gravity (CG) location, and club length. [0007] Current technology provides two methods to adjust overall club length. One such method involves the destruction and removal of the grip on a shaft. Upon removal of the grip by peeling or tearing, the end portion of the shaft is trimmed to decrease the club length or an extension piece is affixed to the end of the shaft to increase its length. Aftermarket extensions are available specifically for this purpose; alternatively, extensions can be made from portions of other golf club shafts that are cut to the desired length and then inserted into the end of the first club&#39;s shaft. The extension piece must match the diameter of the existing shaft, so it is necessary at times to build up the diameter of the extension or existing shaft by adding layers of tape. This method requires that the user making the adjustments have access to potentially expensive new components and tools as well as having a high level of skill. It also causes damage to the original shaft and grip. [0008] The second method of adjusting club length involves replacing the entire shaft and grip using a semi-permanent head-shaft connection device that some manufacturers offer with their clubs, particularly with drivers. The existing shaft may be removed from the driver head and replaced with a different shaft that has either a shorter or longer length. This method is not possible on all clubs, however, as the head must have hardware that allows for removal of the shaft and replacement with a new shaft without damaging the head. [0009] A golfer who does not possess club altering skills or the necessary disposable income to purchase new components likely will be daunted by these two methods of adjusting club length. The first method requires the golfer to make use of several tools to remove the grip and cut the shaft if he or she desires a shorter length, and also to have materials such as tape and a replacement grip on hand to replace the grip and mend any damage caused to the shaft and grip. The skill set required to change the shaft length using this method is usually beyond the abilities of the average golfer, so the golfer would need to seek the services of a golf club fitter or technician to have their club length changed. The second method requires the golfer to buy an entirely new shaft at a different length, which can be very expensive, and also may require the golfer to retain a golf club fitter or technician to replace the shaft. [0010] Ultimately, the two methods described above require an inventory of spare components and above average technical skill, particularly with regard to the first method. It is therefore desirable to facilitate the change of a club&#39;s length using a faster, easier, and less expensive system and method than is currently available. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0011] One aspect of the present invention is a variable length golf club shaft comprising a grip assembly comprising a grip and an upper shaft portion, a lower shaft portion, and a semi-permanent fastener, wherein no portion of the grip is located on the lower shaft portion, and wherein the semi-permanent fastener removably connects the grip assembly to the lower shaft portion. The semi-permanent fastener may be a screw, and the lower shaft portion may comprise a hosel connection portion. The semi-permanent fastener may removably connect the grip assembly to the lower shaft portion along an axis located above the hosel connection portion and below the grip, and the axis may be located no less than 11 inches and no more than 18 inches from a butt end of the grip assembly. [0012] This aspect of the present invention may further comprise an upper adapter affixed to a lower, interior surface of the upper shaft portion, and a lower adapter affixed to an upper, interior surface of the lower shaft portion, wherein each of the upper and lower adapters comprises a bore, and wherein the semi permanent fastener is insertable through the bores of the upper and lower adapters. The upper adapter may comprise a flange. This aspect of the invention may further comprise a fastener captivator located within the upper shaft portion, wherein a fastener head is trapped within the upper adapter between the fastener captivator and the flange.

Furthermore, the technical ability required to modify the golf club length according to this invention is minimal and its approach is intuitive and easy for a golfer to understand. [0041] A first embodiment of the present variable length shaft invention is shown in FIGS. 1-4. According to this embodiment of the invention, and as shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 , two sections of the shaft 10 , the lower shaft and grip section 20 and the upper shaft and grip section 30 , are joined together proximate the upper end 25 and lower end 35 of the shaft portions 24 , 34 , respectively, along a demarcation line 200 , the line at which the two shaft and grip sections 20 , 30 meet. [0042] As shown in FIGS. 1 , 3 , and 4 , the lower shaft and grip section 20 includes a lower grip portion 22 that encircles and is affixed to a lower part of the shaft 24 with double-sided adhesive tape (not shown). In other embodiments, the lower grip portion 22 may be affixed to the shaft 24 with another type of adhesive material. A lower adapter 40 is affixed to or otherwise situated proximate the upper, interior surface of the lower part of the shaft 24 , and a lower-adapter o-ring 80 may be used to seal or otherwise secure the connection between the lower adapter 40 and the interior surface of the lower part of the shaft 24 , as shown in FIG. 4. The lower adapter 40 also contacts an interior surface of the lower grip portion 22 in the first embodiment of the present invention, also as shown in FIG. 4. This adapter 40 includes a threaded hole 45 in its center to receive a screw 50 that allows the adapter 40 to be fastened to the upper shaft and grip section 30. [0043] The upper shaft and grip section 30 correspondingly as an upper grip portion 32 encircling and affixed to an upper shaft portion 34 with double-sided adhesive tape (not shown), or, in other embodiments, another kind of adhesive material. The upper shaft and grip section 30 has an upper adapter 60 affixed to or otherwise situated proximate the lower, interior surface of the upper shaft portion 34 , and an upper-adapter o-ring 90 may be used to seal the connection between the upper adapter 60 and the upper shaft portion 34. The upper adapter 60 also contacts an interior surface of the upper grip portion 32 in the first embodiment of the present invention, which is also on shown in FIG. 4. The upper adapter 60 has a hole 65 , which in the first embodiment is not threaded, in its center to receive the screw 50 that mates with the lower adapter 40 associated with the lower shaft and grip section 20 , and is affixed to a screw captivator 70 that prevents the screw 50 from falling out of or otherwise becoming dislodged from the upper adapter 60. In another embodiment, the hole 65 can be threaded. [0044] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 , assembly of the first embodiment of the invention requires that the lower shaft and grip section 20 and the upper shaft and grip section 30 be aligned and pressed together in their proper orientation at a demarcation line 200 , the line where the two parts connect. The screw 50 located in the upper adapter 60 is threaded into the threaded hole 45 of the lower adapter 40 and tightened with a specifically provided tool 100 , as shown in FIGS. 7A , 7 B, 8 A, and 8 B. The adapters 40 , 60 may further include anti-rotational features to restrict twisting along the shaft axis when they are screwed together. When the screw 50 has been secured, the two shaft and grip sections 20 , 30 are interlocked securely together, thus allowing the club to be used to hit golf balls.

The upper grip portion 32 collar 33 is located at a single opening of the upper grip portion 32 , and the lower grip portion 22 collar 23 is located at an upper opening in the lower grip portion 22. When the upper grip portion 32 contacts the lower grip portion 22 with their respective adapters 60 , 40 installed, as shown in FIG. 5A , the collars 33 , 23 ensure a good fit between the upper and lower grip portions 32 , 22 and consistent grip length during the gripping operation. The collars 33 , 23 also help retain the adapters 60 , 40 within the upper and lower grip portions 32 , 22. By interfacing at a plane 17 normal to the shaft 10 axis 15 , as shown in FIG. 5A , the collars 33 , 23 provide greater contact between the upper and lower grip portions 32 , 22 , than in upper and lower grip portions that do not include collars 33 , 23. [0046] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5B , the collar 33 of the upper grip portion 32 preferably includes one or more slits 33 a - 33 d. These slits 33 a - 33 d can expedite production of upper grip portions 32 having different lengths, as the inclusion of a collar 33 may make it difficult to remove a core bar used to mold the inner diameter of the upper grip portions 32. The slits 33 a - 33 d thus allow for easier removal of the core bar from the upper grip portions 32 after molding is complete.'.\n",

For frequency of physician visits, back pain is second only to upper respiratory infections. In the United States, this malady disables 5.2 million people, and the economic impact has been reported to be as high as $100 billion each year. Though the sources of low back pain are varied, in most cases the intervertebral disc is thought to play a central role. Degeneration of the disc initiates pain in other tissues by altering spinal mechanics and producing non-physiologic stress in surrounding tissues. [0005] The intervertebral disc absorbs most of the compressive load of the spine, but the facet joints of the vertebral bodies share approximately 16%. The disc consists of three distinct parts: the nucleus pulposus, the annular layers and the cartilaginous endplates. The disc maintains its structural properties largely through its ability to attract and retain water. A normal disc contains 80% water in the nucleus pulposus. The nucleus pulposus within a normal disc is rich in water absorbing sulfated glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin and keratan sulfate), creating the swelling pressure to provide tensile stress within the collagen fibers of the annulus. The swelling pressure produced by high water content is crucial to supporting the annular layers for sustaining compressive loads. [0006] In adults, the intervertebral disc is avascular. Survival of the disc cells depends on diffusion of nutrients from external blood vessels and capillaries through the cartilage of the endplates. Diffusion of nutrients also permeates from peripheral blood vessels adjacent to the outer annulus, but these nutrients can only permeate up to 1 cm into the annular layers of the disc. An adult disc can be as large as 5 cm in diameter; hence diffusion through the cranial and caudal endplates is crucial for maintaining the health of the nucleus pulposus and inner annular layers of the disc. [0007] Calcium pyrophosphate and hydroxyapatite are commonly found in the endplate and nucleus pulposus. Beginning as young as 18 years of age, calcified layers begin to accumulate in the cartilaginous endplate. The blood vessels and capillaries at the bone-cartilage interface are gradually occluded by the build-up of the calcified layers, which form into bone. Bone formation at the endplate increases with age. [0008] When the endplate is obliterated by bone, diffusion of nutrients through the calcified endplate is greatly limited. In addition to hindering the diffusion of nutrients, calcified endplates further limit the permeation of oxygen into the disc. Oxygen concentration at the central part of the nucleus is extremely low. Cellularity of the disc is already low compared to most tissues. To obtain necessary nutrients and oxygen, cell activity is restricted to being on or in very close proximity to the cartilaginous endplate. Furthermore, oxygen concentrations are very sensitive to changes in cell density or consumption rate per cell. [0009] The supply of sulfate into the nucleus pulposus for biosynthesizing sulfated glycosaminoglycans is also restricted by the calcified endplates. As a result, the sulfated glycosaminoglycan concentration decreases, leading to lower water content and swelling pressure within the nucleus pulposus. During normal daily compressive loading on the spine, the reduced pressure within the nucleus pulposus can no longer distribute forces evenly along the circumference of the inner annulus to keep the lamellae bulging outward. As a result, the inner lamellae sag inward while the outer annulus continues to bulge outward, causing delamination of the annular layers. [0010] The shear stresses causing annular delamination and bulging are highest at the posteriolateral portions adjacent to the neuroforamen. The nerve is confined within the neuroforamen between the disc and the facet joint. Hence, the nerve at the neuroforamen is vulnerable to impingement by the bulging disc or bone spurs. [0011] When oxygen concentration in the disc falls below 0.25 kPa (1.9 mm Hg), production of lactic acid dramatically increases with increasing distance from the endplate. The pH within the disc falls as lactic acid concentration increases. Lactic acid diffuses through micro-tears of the annulus irritating the richly innervated posterior longitudinal ligament, facet joint and/or nerve root. Studies indicate that lumbar pain correlates well with high lactate levels and low pH. The mean pH of symptomatic discs was significantly lower than the mean pH of normal discs. Acid concentration is three times higher in symptomatic discs than normal discs. In symptomatic discs with pH 6.65, the acid concentration within the disc is 5.6 times the plasma level. In some preoperative symptomatic discs, nerve roots were found to be surrounded by dense fibrous scars and adhesions with remarkably low pH 5.7-6.30. The acid concentration within these discs was 50 times the plasma level. [0012] Approximately 85% of patients with low back pain cannot be given a precise pathoanatomical diagnosis. This type of pain is generally classified under “non-specific pain”. Back pain and sciatica can be recapitulated by maneuvers that do not affect the nerve root, such as intradiscal saline injection, discography, and compression of the posterior longitudinal ligaments. It is possible that some of the non-specific pain is caused by lactic acid irritation secreted from the disc. Injection into the disc can flush out the lactic acid. Maneuvering and compression can also drive out the irritating acid to produce non-specific pain. Currently, no intervention other than discectomy can halt the production of lactic acid. [0013] In the presence of oxygen, metabolism of each glucose molecule produces 36 adenosine triphosphates, ATP, through glycolysis, citric acid cycle and electron transport chain. ATP is a high-energy compound essential for driving biosynthesis of the water-retaining proteoglycans. Under anaerobic conditions, the metabolism of each glucose molecule produces only 2 ATP and two lactic acids. Hence, production of high-energy compound ATP is low under anaerobic conditions within the disc. [0014] The nucleus pulposus is thought to function as “the air in a tire” to pressurize the disc. To support the load, the pressure effectively distributes the forces evenly along the circumference of the inner annulus and keeps the lamellae bulging outward. The process of disc degeneration begins with calcification of the endplates, which hinders diffusion of sulfate and oxygen into the nucleus pulposus. As a result, production of the water absorbing sulfated glycosaminoglycans is significantly reduced, and the water content within the nucleus decreases. The inner annular lamellae begin to sag inward, and the tension on collagen fibers within the annulus is lost. The degenerated disc exhibits unstable movement, similar to a flat tire. Approximately 20-30% of low-back-pain patients have been diagnosed as having spinal segmental instability. The pain may originate from stress and increased load on the facet joints and/or surrounding ligaments. In addition, pH within the disc becomes acidic from the anaerobic production of lactic acid, which irritates adjacent nerves and tissues. [0015] The method of endplate puncturing for drawing nutrients from the vertebral body to regenerate the degenerated disc is described in PCT/US2002/04301 (WO 2002/064044) by J. Yeung and T. Yeung filed on Feb. 13, 2002 with U.S. Provisional application 60/268,666 filed on Feb. 13, 2001. [0016] Shunts or conduits for re-establishing the exchange of nutrients and waste between the degenerative disc and bodily circulation is described in PCT/US2004/14368 (WO 2004/101015) and U.S. application Ser. Nos. 10/840,816 by J. Yeung and T. Yeung, both applications filed on May 7, 2004. U.S. provisional patent application 60/626,644, filed on Nov. 10, 2004 by Jeffrey E. Yeung also described several disc shunt (conduit) configurations and delivery devices. [0017] Discs L4-5 and L5-S1 are shielded by the iliac, inaccessible by straight needle from outside to deliver the conduit into the disc. However, through the pedicle of the vertebral body, the elastically curved needle proposed in PCT/US2005/22749 (WO 2006/002417), filed on Jun. 22, 2005 by J. Yeung, can puncture through the calcified endplate to deliver the shunt or conduit for exchanging nutrients and lactate between the avascular disc and bodily circulation. [0018] Chemical or physical modification of the disc shunt was proposed in PCT/US2006/44795, filed on Nov. 17, 2006 by James E. Kemler and Jeffrey E. Yeung for enhancing, selecting or delaying molecular transport into and out of the avascular disc. [0019] By re-supplying the disc cells with nutrients and oxygen through disc shunt or conduit, biosynthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans may increase to retain additional water and sustain compressive loading. Hence, segmental instability and excessive loading of facet joints are minimized to alleviate back pain. With the presence of additional oxygen, production of lactic acid may decrease to minimize acidic irritation and increase production of ATP, driving biosynthesis of the water-retaining proteoglycans. SUMMARY OF INVENTION [0020] One end of a U-shaped shunt is inserted into the lumen of a needle while the other end is draped outside the needle. As the needle punctures into a disc, the outside strand of the shunt is squeezed beside the outside wall of the needle, pressing into the annulus through a very small punctured hole. During needle withdrawal, the friction between the outside strand and the annulus grips the U-shaped shunt, allowing the inside strand to slide out the lumen of the needle to deploy the U-shaped shunt within the disc. Since the U-shaped shunt is tightly press-fitted into the elastic annulus, hydrostatic pressure is preserved within the shunted disc. [0021] Another U-shaped shunt can be linked to the outside strand to increase (1) friction for shunt deployment, (2) press-fit capacity, and (3) rate of nutrient and waste exchange to regenerate the intervertebral disc. Additives, buffer, nutrients, growth factor and cells can also be incorporated into the U-shaped shunts to expedite disc regeneration and alleviate back pain.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS [0081] Disc shunt 126 is a flexible and semi-permeable conduit transporting nutrients, waste and oxygen between bodily circulation and the avascular disc 100. The disc shunt 126 is bent into a U- or V-configuration. The lengths of the bent portions do not have to be equal. One end of the U-shaped shunt 126 is inserted into the lumen 269 of a thin needle 101 while the other end of the U-shaped shunt 126 is draped over the outside wall of the thin needle 101 , as shown in FIG. 1. [0082] Since diffusion of nutrients can only penetrate up to 1 cm into the annular layers, the U-shaped disc shunt 126 is delivered deep into the annulus by puncturing the disc 100 with the needle 101 , as shown in FIG. 2. As the needle 101 punctures into the disc 100 , the outside strand of the U-shaped shunt 126 is pulled, dragged and tightly pressed against the annular layers beside the outside wall of the needle 101 through a small puncture hole. During needle 101 withdrawal, the contact friction between the annulus and the outside strand of the U-shaped shunt 126 holds or anchors the shunt 126 , allowing the inside strand to slide out the lumen 269 of the needle 101 , as shown in FIG. 3. Since one strand is press-fitted within a small puncture, the U-shaped shunt 126 is well sealed within the elastic annular layers to preserve the hydrostatic pressure of the disc 100. [0083] FIG. 3 shows that the U-loop of the shunt 126 is deployed within the disc 100 with the proximal ends of the shunt 126 extending outside the disc 100 , in contact with bodily circulation.'.\n",

      "Changed 'bottles' by 'assembly' in 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to containers for holding a number of bottles, and in particular to bottles containing fluids such as toiletries. 2. Description of Related Art Travelers often carry in their luggage a number of toiletries, such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash or gel, shaving cream, toothpaste, hand or facial lotion, after shave, etc. Full-size bottles of such toiletries are ordinarily too bulky to be carried on most trips. Carrying several miniature bottles may be feasible but finding them all at shower or bath time can be a problem. Some travelers use a toiletries kit, which is a small zippered pouch holding a variety of toiletries. While such a kit will keep toiletries together and organized, the kit cannot be brought into a shower stall and used during a shower. Furthermore, accessing individual bottles is cumbersome since the traveler must hunt through the kit, identify the correct bottle, remove the bottle, and then use and replace it before searching for the next bottle. U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,182 shows a complicated panel that is not designed for easy portability. A shell 24 has a cover 28 hinged to the top of a back panel 26 , which may be secured to a shower wall by glue, screws, or two-sided adhesive foam. A number of bottles can be placed on back panel 26 so lower pump handles 74 can protrude through cover 28. The panel has complex structure for holding bottles in a predetermined position. Bottles 20 can be filled with shampoo, grooming liquids, etc. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,251 the bottles 16 can be filled with shampoo, conditioner, hand lotion, etc. Thereafter, the pump handles 32 can be inserted through holes in cover 14 , which is then locked in place on back panel 12 so that caps 54 rest on ledge 56. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,349,967 bottles 36 are screwed into annular tops 40 , which are glued into counterbores 22 of countertop 12. The hinged front door 66 can be swung down in order to unscrew and refill bottles 36 with shampoo, mouthwash, hand lotion, etc. In FIG. 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,580 bottles of shampoo and conditioner can be placed on shelves with their valve caps extending through notches in the shelves. The hanger is shown suspended by a hook on a shower head pipe. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,503 housing 11 is mounted in a shower and a number of bottles 30 can be screwed into the underside of housing. The housing has a hand pump and dispenser nozzle for dispensing shampoo, etc. In FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 3,178,061 four containers 34 rest on shelf 22 on the inside of refrigerator door 14. Faucets 28 protrude through notches in the front apron of shelf 22. Containers 34 can be filled with beverages by removing covers 42. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,044,522, shampoo, conditioner, etc. can be poured through the openings 24 to fill the compartments 14 in container 12 , which is suspended from the shower head by hanger 16. These liquids are dispensed by pressing dispensing buttons 56. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,322,242 four large bottles of different cleaning chemicals are placed on a top rack and connected by caps 47 and tubes 42 to siphoning valves 28. When one of the siphoning valves 28 is operated, water from hose connection 31 is discharged while the cleaning chemical is drawn from one of the large bottles and mixed with the water. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,462 bottles 18 and 20 can be removed from receiver 26 and replaced. The bottles are filled with oil and can be lifted as shown in FIG. 2 so that oil will be siphoned through line 22 to a shower head. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,955,715 interlocking containers can be secured to the wall of a shower by adhesive strips. The container lids can be removed to refill the container with shampoo, liquid soap, etc. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,728,006 squeeze bottles can be hung valve-end-down from a towel rack to dispense shampoo, conditioner, etc. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,808,090 a suction cup supports a handle that is inserted into a pocket molded in the side of a bottle of shampoo, conditioner, or the like. Accordingly, there is a need for an container that can hold a number of toiletry bottles that can be easily transported. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the illustrative embodiments demonstrating features and advantages of the present invention, there is provided a pack for carrying and dispensing toiletries. The pack includes a container having (a) a floor with at least one lower opening, and (b) at least one wall with a front, a back, a right and a left portion. Also included is a plurality of bottles with pumping heads adapted to fit in the container with the pumping heads projecting through the at least one lower opening of the container. Each of the pumping heads, when inverted, are operable to dispense fluid from the bottle. The pack also includes a cover for locking the bottles in the container and providing a backstop for the bottles during operation of the pumping heads. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a pack is provided for carrying a plurality of bottles with pumping heads for dispensing toiletries. The pack includes a container having (a) a floor with at least one lower opening, and (b) at least one wall with a front, a back, a right and a left portion. The container is adapted to hold the plurality of bottles. The lower opening is arranged to allow the pumping heads to project through the at least one lower opening of the container. The pack also includes a cover for locking the bottles in the container and providing a backstop for the bottles during operation of the pumping heads. In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for carrying a plurality of bottles with pumping heads in a container with an open top and a floor with an opening. The method includes the steps of filling the plurality of bottles with different fluids at a first location, and placing the plurality of bottles inside the container with the pumping heads projecting through the opening in the floor of the container. Another step is covering the open top of the container to lock the bottles in the container and provide a backstop for the bottles during operation of the pumping heads. The method also includes the step of traveling to a destination with the bottles in the container, and hanging the container with the bottles from a shower head pipe with the pumping heads of the bottles pointing down. Another step is operating the pumping head of at least one of the bottles while the container is suspended from the shower head pipe. By employing apparatus and methods of the foregoing type an improved toiletries pack is achieved. In one embodiment, a number of pump bottles can be placed, pumping head down, in a five-sided box that is open on top. The floor of the box has a number of holes designed to allow passage of the pumping heads. The box can be closed with a sliding lid, or with a hinged or snap-on lid that presses the pump bottles in place. Bundled in this fashion, the collection of pump bottles can be conveniently packed in a traveler&#39;s luggage. The bottles can contain shampoo, conditioner, body wash or gel, shaving cream, toothpaste, hand or facial lotion, after shave, etc. The bottle&#39;s pumping heads can be swivelled to lock them closed, in some embodiments. The box can be suspended by a strap, hook, or the like from the pipe of a shower head without unpacking the pump bottles. In some cases the box can be mounted elsewhere in a shower stall with suction cups. The pump bottles can be used by pressing the pump heads. In some embodiments the box can have a ledge (cantilevered or recessed) where a user can place one or more fingers to brace the box while another finger (or fingers) operates the pumping heads. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The above brief description as well as other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more fully appreciated by reference to the following detailed description of presently preferred but nonetheless illustrative embodiments in accordance with the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein: FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a pack in accordance with principles of present invention; FIG. 2 is a left elevational view of the pack of FIG. 1 ; FIG. 3 is a bottom view of the pack of FIG. 1 ; FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a pack that is an alternate to that of FIG. 1 ; and FIG. 5 is a perspective view of a pack that is an alternate to those shown in the previous drawings. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to FIGS. 1–3 , a pack is shown employing a container 10 in the form of a five-sided box that is open on top. Box 10 has a left portion 10 A, a right portion 10 B, a front portion 10 C, and a back portion 10 D. Box 10 has a floor 12 that is oversized and extends anteriorly into a cantilevered ledge 12 A. A cover 14 is shown as a panel designed to slide into inside slots 16 formed at the inside of the upper edge of left portion 10 A and right portion 10 B. The box can be made by injection molding, stamping and folding, or by assembling a number of discrete panels by means of glue, fasteners, snapping features, and the like. The box can be made of plastic, wood, metal, ceramic, composite materials, etc. In this embodiment ledge 12 A is 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) deep and excluding the ledge, container 10 is, 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) deep, 5.5 inches (14 cm) wide, and 3.75 inches (9.5 cm) tall, although other dimensions and proportions can be employed in other embodiments. A mirror 18 is secured to front portion 10 C. A pair of suction cups 20 is attached to back portion 10. A hanger in the form of a flexible strap 22 has its two ends secured to the upper corners of the back portion 10 D. Strap 22 is designed to suspend container 10 from a showerhead pipe P, which feeds a showerhead S. Four identical bottles 24 can fit side-by-side inside container 10. Three of them are shown inside the container 10. Projecting from the bottom of all of the bottles 24 is a pumping head 26 having a plunger 28 with a nozzle 30. Pumping head 26 is a conventional device that can dispense the fluid inside bottle 24 by vertically reciprocating plunger 28 so the fluid is dispensed through nozzle 30. Each of the bottles 24 is can be refilled by unscrewing pumping head 26 from the externally threaded collar (not shown) at the bottom of bottle 24. Pumping head 26 is of the type that can be locked to prevent leakage by rotating plunger 26 approximately 90°. In this embodiment bottle 24 has an overall height of 5.25 (13 cm) inches, a thickness of 1 inch (2.5 cm), and a width of 2 inches (5 cm). Excluding the pumping head 26 , bottle 24 has a generally rectangular shape with rounded edges and corners and is designed to hold about four ounces (12 ml) of fluid. The main body of bottles 24 can be made of glass, plastic, metal, or other materials. The pumping head 26 has an overall outside diameter of 1 inch (2.5 cm) and an overall height of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). The plunger 28 has a diameter of 0.75 inch (1.9 cm) and a height of 0.5 inch (1.3 cm). It will be appreciated that bottles of different sizes, shapes and capacities can be employed in other embodiments. Bottles 24 are designed to be filled with any one of various fluids, such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash or gel, shaving cream, toothpaste, hand or facial lotion, after shave, etc. The pumping heads 26 of bottles 24 are shown projecting through four keyhole-shaped apertures 32 (lower opening) in the floor 12. The slot 32 A of each of the holes 32 is designed to pass the nozzle 30 of pumping head 26. Thus, when cover 14 is slid in slots 16 over the top of bottles 24 , the bottles are securely pressed against the floor 12 so that the pumping heads 26 are fixed in place. Referring to FIG. 4 , components identical to those previously illustrated in FIGS. 1–3 bear the same reference numerals. Container 34 has a shape fairly similar to the previously mentioned container (container 10 FIG. 1 ) and is fitted with the same mirror 18 in front. Container 34 will also have holes similar to those previously described (holes 32 of FIG. 3 ). Container 34 differs in that its ledge is in the form of an alcove 36. Also, container 34 has a locking rim 38 in the form of a small flange. A cover 40 is shown as a lid having a dependent lip designed to snap over the locking rim 38 to hold bottles 24 in place. Attached to back of container 34 is a hook 44 designed to suspend container 34 from the previously mentioned showerhead pipe. Referring to FIG. 5 , components identical to those previously illustrated in FIGS. 1–3 bear the same reference numerals. Container 46 has a shape fairly similar to the previously mentioned container (container 10 FIG. 1 ) but is somewhat larger and is designed to hold six bottles 24 side-by-side. The front of container 46 has a mirror 48 that fits flush in a recess. Container 46 will also have holes similar to those previously described (holes 32 of FIG. 3 ). Container 46 has a molded cantilevered ledge 50 with a curved, sloping upper surface. Hinged to the rear upper edge of container 46 is a cover 52 having a latch 54 designed to snap cover 52 closed on container 46. A strap 58 is looped through a pair of holes 56 on cover 52. Strap 58 is designed to suspend container 46 on a showerhead pipe. To facilitate an understanding of the principles associated with the foregoing apparatus, its operation will be briefly described in connection with the embodiment of FIGS. 1–3. It will be appreciated that the operation of the other embodiments will be similar. With the cover 14 removed as shown in FIG. 1 , each of the bottles 24 can be opened by unscrewing its pumping head 26 (head pointing up) in order to fill the bottle with an appropriate toiletry, such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash or gel, shaving cream, toothpaste, hand or facial lotion, after shave, etc. Thereafter, the pumping head 26 can be screwed back in place and the bottles 24 placed inside container 10 with pumping heads 26 projecting down through the lower openings 32 as shown in FIG. 3. Cover 14 can then be slid into slots 16 to clamp bottles 24 in place. If the user is planning to travel, the plungers 28 can be rotated to close the pumping heads 26. This allows the pack to be conveniently stored in luggage without substantial risk of leakage. When the traveler wishes to use the pack, plungers 26 are then rotated back into the operative position illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3. The strap 22 may then be used to suspend container 10 on showerhead pipe P. Suction cups 20 can provide additional stability by holding container 10 securely against the wall of a shower stall. Referring to the hand H of FIG. 2 , the user may now place a thumb on ledge 12 A and one or more other fingers under plunger 28. By lifting these other fingers plunger 28 is depressed so that the fluid inside the associated bottle 24 is dispensed through nozzle 30 onto the user&#39;s fingers. The upward pressure on plunger 28 from these fingers is counteracted by the downward thumb pressure on ledge 12 A so that container 10 essentially stays fixed in place. The mirror 18 can be used at any time before, during, or after operation of pumping head 26. When the container 10 and its contents are no longer needed in a shower, the pack can be stored as an organized group of toiletries, for example in the user&#39;s luggage. Because the various bottles 24 are kept together, they remain organized and are easily found when needed during a shower or any other time. It is appreciated that various modifications may be implemented with respect to the above described, preferred embodiment. In some embodiments the foregoing containers can have a plan that is circular, oval, polygonal, etc. Also, the bottles may have an outline that is circular, oval, polygonal, etc. Additionally, the inside of the container may have appropriate ridges, dividing walls or channels designed to embrace the bottles and keep them in position. Also, two, three or any greater number of bottles may be employed and the container will be sized accordingly. Furthermore, container may at times have less than the maximum number of bottles that will fit. Additionally, various types of alternate pumps can be used and in some cases the bottles will be installed in holes in the container floor before screwing the pump heads onto the bottles. Moreover, the hanger for suspending the pack on a showerhead pipe may attach to different parts of the container, and in some cases may be in the form of a wireframe, a basket, a shelf, etc.'.\n",

      "Changed 'bottles' by 'pressure' in 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to containers for holding a number of bottles, and in particular to bottles containing fluids such as toiletries. 2. Description of Related Art Travelers often carry in their luggage a number of toiletries, such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash or gel, shaving cream, toothpaste, hand or facial lotion, after shave, etc. Full-size bottles of such toiletries are ordinarily too bulky to be carried on most trips. Carrying several miniature bottles may be feasible but finding them all at shower or bath time can be a problem. Some travelers use a toiletries kit, which is a small zippered pouch holding a variety of toiletries. While such a kit will keep toiletries together and organized, the kit cannot be brought into a shower stall and used during a shower. Furthermore, accessing individual bottles is cumbersome since the traveler must hunt through the kit, identify the correct bottle, remove the bottle, and then use and replace it before searching for the next bottle. U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,182 shows a complicated panel that is not designed for easy portability. A shell 24 has a cover 28 hinged to the top of a back panel 26 , which may be secured to a shower wall by glue, screws, or two-sided adhesive foam. A number of bottles can be placed on back panel 26 so lower pump handles 74 can protrude through cover 28. The panel has complex structure for holding bottles in a predetermined position. Bottles 20 can be filled with shampoo, grooming liquids, etc. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,251 the bottles 16 can be filled with shampoo, conditioner, hand lotion, etc. Thereafter, the pump handles 32 can be inserted through holes in cover 14 , which is then locked in place on back panel 12 so that caps 54 rest on ledge 56. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,349,967 bottles 36 are screwed into annular tops 40 , which are glued into counterbores 22 of countertop 12. The hinged front door 66 can be swung down in order to unscrew and refill bottles 36 with shampoo, mouthwash, hand lotion, etc. In FIG. 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,580 bottles of shampoo and conditioner can be placed on shelves with their valve caps extending through notches in the shelves. The hanger is shown suspended by a hook on a shower head pipe. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,503 housing 11 is mounted in a shower and a number of bottles 30 can be screwed into the underside of housing. The housing has a hand pump and dispenser nozzle for dispensing shampoo, etc. In FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 3,178,061 four containers 34 rest on shelf 22 on the inside of refrigerator door 14. Faucets 28 protrude through notches in the front apron of shelf 22. Containers 34 can be filled with beverages by removing covers 42. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,044,522, shampoo, conditioner, etc. can be poured through the openings 24 to fill the compartments 14 in container 12 , which is suspended from the shower head by hanger 16. These liquids are dispensed by pressing dispensing buttons 56. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,322,242 four large bottles of different cleaning chemicals are placed on a top rack and connected by caps 47 and tubes 42 to siphoning valves 28. When one of the siphoning valves 28 is operated, water from hose connection 31 is discharged while the cleaning chemical is drawn from one of the large bottles and mixed with the water. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,462 bottles 18 and 20 can be removed from receiver 26 and replaced. The bottles are filled with oil and can be lifted as shown in FIG. 2 so that oil will be siphoned through line 22 to a shower head. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,955,715 interlocking containers can be secured to the wall of a shower by adhesive strips. The container lids can be removed to refill the container with shampoo, liquid soap, etc. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,728,006 squeeze bottles can be hung valve-end-down from a towel rack to dispense shampoo, conditioner, etc. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,808,090 a suction cup supports a handle that is inserted into a pocket molded in the side of a bottle of shampoo, conditioner, or the like. Accordingly, there is a need for an container that can hold a number of toiletry bottles that can be easily transported.

The box can be made by injection molding, stamping and folding, or by assembling a number of discrete panels by means of glue, fasteners, snapping features, and the like. The box can be made of plastic, wood, metal, ceramic, composite materials, etc. In this embodiment ledge 12 A is 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) deep and excluding the ledge, container 10 is, 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) deep, 5.5 inches (14 cm) wide, and 3.75 inches (9.5 cm) tall, although other dimensions and proportions can be employed in other embodiments. A mirror 18 is secured to front portion 10 C. A pair of suction cups 20 is attached to back portion 10. A hanger in the form of a flexible strap 22 has its two ends secured to the upper corners of the back portion 10 D. Strap 22 is designed to suspend container 10 from a showerhead pipe P, which feeds a showerhead S. Four identical bottles 24 can fit side-by-side inside container 10. Three of them are shown inside the container 10. Projecting from the bottom of all of the bottles 24 is a pumping head 26 having a plunger 28 with a nozzle 30. Pumping head 26 is a conventional device that can dispense the fluid inside bottle 24 by vertically reciprocating plunger 28 so the fluid is dispensed through nozzle 30. Each of the bottles 24 is can be refilled by unscrewing pumping head 26 from the externally threaded collar (not shown) at the bottom of bottle 24. Pumping head 26 is of the type that can be locked to prevent leakage by rotating plunger 26 approximately 90°. In this embodiment bottle 24 has an overall height of 5.25 (13 cm) inches, a thickness of 1 inch (2.5 cm), and a width of 2 inches (5 cm). Excluding the pumping head 26 , bottle 24 has a generally rectangular shape with rounded edges and corners and is designed to hold about four ounces (12 ml) of fluid. The main body of bottles 24 can be made of glass, plastic, metal, or other materials. The pumping head 26 has an overall outside diameter of 1 inch (2.5 cm) and an overall height of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). The plunger 28 has a diameter of 0.75 inch (1.9 cm) and a height of 0.5 inch (1.3 cm). It will be appreciated that bottles of different sizes, shapes and capacities can be employed in other embodiments. Bottles 24 are designed to be filled with any one of various fluids, such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash or gel, shaving cream, toothpaste, hand or facial lotion, after shave, etc. The pumping heads 26 of bottles 24 are shown projecting through four keyhole-shaped apertures 32 (lower opening) in the floor 12. The slot 32 A of each of the holes 32 is designed to pass the nozzle 30 of pumping head 26. Thus, when cover 14 is slid in slots 16 over the top of bottles 24 , the bottles are securely pressed against the floor 12 so that the pumping heads 26 are fixed in place. Referring to FIG. 4 , components identical to those previously illustrated in FIGS. 1–3 bear the same reference numerals. Container 34 has a shape fairly similar to the previously mentioned container (container 10 FIG. 1 ) and is fitted with the same mirror 18 in front. Container 34 will also have holes similar to those previously described (holes 32 of FIG. 3 ). Container 34 differs in that its ledge is in the form of an alcove 36. Also, container 34 has a locking rim 38 in the form of a small flange. A cover 40 is shown as a lid having a dependent lip designed to snap over the locking rim 38 to hold bottles 24 in place. Attached to back of container 34 is a hook 44 designed to suspend container 34 from the previously mentioned showerhead pipe. Referring to FIG. 5 , components identical to those previously illustrated in FIGS. 1–3 bear the same reference numerals. Container 46 has a shape fairly similar to the previously mentioned container (container 10 FIG. 1 ) but is somewhat larger and is designed to hold six bottles 24 side-by-side. The front of container 46 has a mirror 48 that fits flush in a recess. Container 46 will also have holes similar to those previously described (holes 32 of FIG. 3 ). Container 46 has a molded cantilevered ledge 50 with a curved, sloping upper surface. Hinged to the rear upper edge of container 46 is a cover 52 having a latch 54 designed to snap cover 52 closed on container 46. A strap 58 is looped through a pair of holes 56 on cover 52. Strap 58 is designed to suspend container 46 on a showerhead pipe. To facilitate an understanding of the principles associated with the foregoing apparatus, its operation will be briefly described in connection with the embodiment of FIGS. 1–3. It will be appreciated that the operation of the other embodiments will be similar. With the cover 14 removed as shown in FIG. 1 , each of the bottles 24 can be opened by unscrewing its pumping head 26 (head pointing up) in order to fill the bottle with an appropriate toiletry, such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash or gel, shaving cream, toothpaste, hand or facial lotion, after shave, etc. Thereafter, the pumping head 26 can be screwed back in place and the bottles 24 placed inside container 10 with pumping heads 26 projecting down through the lower openings 32 as shown in FIG. 3. Cover 14 can then be slid into slots 16 to clamp bottles 24 in place. If the user is planning to travel, the plungers 28 can be rotated to close the pumping heads 26. This allows the pack to be conveniently stored in luggage without substantial risk of leakage. When the traveler wishes to use the pack, plungers 26 are then rotated back into the operative position illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3. The strap 22 may then be used to suspend container 10 on showerhead pipe P. Suction cups 20 can provide additional stability by holding container 10 securely against the wall of a shower stall. Referring to the hand H of FIG. 2 , the user may now place a thumb on ledge 12 A and one or more other fingers under plunger 28. By lifting these other fingers plunger 28 is depressed so that the fluid inside the associated bottle 24 is dispensed through nozzle 30 onto the user&#39;s fingers. The upward pressure on plunger 28 from these fingers is counteracted by the downward thumb pressure on ledge 12 A so that container 10 essentially stays fixed in place. The mirror 18 can be used at any time before, during, or after operation of pumping head 26. When the container 10 and its contents are no longer needed in a shower, the pack can be stored as an organized group of toiletries, for example in the user&#39;s luggage. Because the various bottles 24 are kept together, they remain organized and are easily found when needed during a shower or any other time. It is appreciated that various modifications may be implemented with respect to the above described, preferred embodiment. In some embodiments the foregoing containers can have a plan that is circular, oval, polygonal, etc. Also, the bottles may have an outline that is circular, oval, polygonal, etc. Additionally, the inside of the container may have appropriate ridges, dividing walls or channels designed to embrace the bottles and keep them in position.

      "Changed 'onjisaponin' by 'catheter' in 'CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application having Ser. No. 61/866,045 filed 15 Aug. 2013, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. FIELD OF INVENTION [0002] This invention relates to a novel autophagy enhancer and the use thereof in treating neurodegenerative diseases. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION [0003] Autophagy is a cellular process that involves the formation of an isolated membrane to form double membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) that sequesters the cytoplasmic materials. Followed by fusion of the autophagosome with lysosome to form an autolysosome, all the engulfed materials are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases to recycle intracellular nutrients and energy [1, 2]. Autophagy-lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways are the two major protein degradation pathways in cells [3]. While short-lived nuclear and cytosolic proteins are degraded by proteasomes, large membrane proteins, oligomers and aggregates which cannot pass through the narrow pore of the proteasome barrel are degraded by autophagy [4]. [0004] A variety of neurodegenerative diseases are caused by toxic, aggregate-prone or oligomeric proteins [5-9]. For example, Huntington&#39;s disease (HD) is caused by an over 35 CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion, which results in a long mutant polyQ tract in the huntingtin protein. These polyQ expansions are highly associated with the aggregate formation and toxicity [10, 11]. Autophagy, however, can reduce mutant huntingtin protein levels and its toxicity in cell and mouse models [6, 7]. Parkinson disease (PD) is caused by A53T or A30P α-synuclein mutants, which are identified as substrates of autophagy, and the clearance of these mutant proteins are also highly dependent on autophagy for removal [6-8, 11-14]. Pharmacological activation of autophagy reduces the levels and toxicity of mutant huntingtin, mutant proteins in spinocerebellar ataxia, mutant α-synuclein and mutant tau in either mouse or drosophila models [5, 15]. Furthermore, autophagy-related gene (ATG) knockdown leads to aggregate formation and toxicity in C.elegans [ 16, 17]. In addition to the formation of protein aggregates, the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum, and an increase in the size and number of lipid droplets were observed in ATG gene knockout animal models [14, 18-20]. SUMMARY OF INVENTION [0005] In the light of the foregoing background, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel autophagy enhancer with potential therapeutic application in neurodegenerative diseases by enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, and reduces α-synuclein oligomerization. As a result, the autophagy enhancer is able to recover from mutant huntingtin or α-synuclein-induced neuronal cell death. [0006] In the first aspect, the present invention relates to a method of preventing, treating and/or delaying the onset of neurodegenerative diseases comprising administering an effective amount of Onjisaponin B to a subject in need thereof. [0007] In one embodiment, Onjisaponin B is isolated from Chinese medicinal herbs, Radix Polygalae. [0008] In another embodiment, the neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the buildup of oligomeric proteins comprising mutant huntingtin and mutant α-synuclein. [0009] In yet another embodiment, the neurodegenerative diseases are selected from a group consisting of Parkinson&#39;s disease, and Huntington&#39;s disease. [0010] In another aspect of this invention, a use of Onjisaponin B as an autophagy enhancer for treating neurodegenerative diseases is provided. In one embodiment, Onjisaponin B has been described in the foregoing paragraph(s); in another embodiment, the neurodegenerative diseases have also been described in the foregoing paragraph(s). [0011] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising Onjisaponin B admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier for treating neurodegenerative diseases. In one embodiment, Onjisaponin B has been described in the foregoing paragraph(s); in another embodiment, the neurodegenerative diseases have also been described in the foregoing paragraph(s). [0012] In another aspect, the present invention provides a dietary supplement comprising Onjisaponin B admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier for treating neurodegenerative diseases. In one embodiment, Onjisaponin B has been described in the foregoing paragraph(s); in another embodiment, the neurodegenerative diseases have also been described in the foregoing paragraph(s). [0013] The present invention is based on the identification of novel autophagy enhancer, Onjisaponin B as mentioned above. The invention is also based on the neuroprotective effect of Onjisaponin B on neuronal cells via enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, as well as preventing the oligomerization of α-synuclein. [0014] Onjisaponin B exhibits no significant cytotoxic effect on a rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells (PC 12) up to 100 μM. It is also relatively non-toxic to mouse, rat and human neuronal cells and brain tissues. [0015] Onjisaponin B is a novel autophagy enhancer isolated from Radix Polygalae and has never been reported before. Also, Onjisaponin B is capable of inducing autophagy in cells and animals. [0016] Onjisaponin B-induced autophagy is dependent on autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7); further, Onjisaponin B is capable of inducing autophagy in Atg7-dependent manner [0017] Besides, Onjisaponin B induces autophagy via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Onjisaponin B is capable of inducing autophagy via modulation of AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. [0018] Further, Onjisaponin B enhances the clearance of mutant huntingtin and mutant A53T α-synuclein; further, Onjisaponin B is capable of enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin and mutant A53T α-synuclein. [0019] Onjisaponin B enhances the clearance of mutant huntingtin in autophagy-wild type cells, but not in autophagy-deficient cells; further, Onjisaponin B is capable of enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin through autophagy induction. [0020] Onjisaponin B reduces the oligomerization of α-synuclein; further, Onjisaponin B is capable of reducing the oligomerization of α-synuclein. [0021] Onjisaponin B reduces toxicity in PC-12 cells expressing either mutant huntingtin or mutant A53T α-synuclein; further, Onjisaponin B is capable of recovering from the mutant huntingtin or mutant A53T α-synuclein-mediated toxicity in neuronal cells or tissues. [0022] Onjisaponin B can be developed as novel neuroprotective agents for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES [0023] FIG. 1 shows the chemical structure of Onjisaponin B. [0024] FIG. 2 a and FIG. 2 b show the results of cytotoxicity study of Onjisaponin B in PC12 cells. [0025] FIG. 3 a , FIG. 3 b and FIG. 3 c show that Onjisaponin B induces autophagic GFP-LC3 puncta formation, LC3-II conversion and autophagic flux in PC12 cells. [0026] FIG. 4 shows that Onjisaponin B-induced autophagy is dependent on the presence of autophagy-related gene7 (Atg7). [0027] FIG. 5 a and FIG. 5 b show that Onjisaponin B activates autophagy through an AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. [0028] FIG. 6 a and FIG. 6 b show that Onjisaponin B enhances the clearance of mutant huntingtin and mutant A53T α-synuclein. [0029] FIG. 7 a , FIG. 7 b and FIG. 7 c show that Onjisaponin B enhances the clearance of mutant huntingtin in autophagy-wild type cells, but not in autophagy-deficient cells.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0032] As used herein and in the claims, “comprising” means including the following elements but not excluding others. [0033] In this study, novel autophagy enhancers with neuroprotective effects by evaluating their efficacy in enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, and in increasing of cells viability, are identified. Through screening of their library of natural product extracts from the Chinese medicinal herbs, inventors have demonstrated that both ethanol extract of Radix Polygalae and its single component, Onjisaponin B, are able to induce autophagy with potential therapeutic application in neurodegeneration. [0034] The formula, molecular weight and accurate mass of Onjisaponin B are summarized in Table 1 below.

[0036] The following preparations and examples are given to enable those skilled in the art to more clearly understand and to practice the present invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being illustrative and representative thereof. EXAMPLE 1 [0037] This example describes in vitro cytotoxicity of Onjisaponin B in a rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells (PC12). [0038] Cell culture and cytotoxicity assay: The test compound of Onjisaponin B was dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 100 mmol/L and stored at −20° C. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously [28]. PC-12, 4000 cells were seeded on 96-well plates per well. After overnight pre-incubation, the cells were exposed to different concentrations of Onjisaponin B (0.039-100 μmol/L) for 2 days. Subsequently, 10 μL of MTT reagents was added to each well and incubated at 37° C. for 4 hours followed by the addition of 100 μL solubilization buffer (10% SDS in 0.01 mol/L HCl) and overnight incubation. Absorbance at 585 nm was determined from each well the next day. For cell viability assay measured by crystal violet staining, PC-12 cells were incubated in 35 mm disc followed by the addition of Onjisaponin B at the indicated concentrations for 24 hours. The cells were then incubated with crystal violet for 10 minutes followed by a ddH 2 O wash. The stained cells image was captured by CCD digital camera Spot RT3™ under the Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope with 4× magnification. Cell viability was quantified by dissolving the stained cells in 10% acetic acid (200 μL/well). The colorimetric reading of the solute mixture was then determined by spectrophotometer at OD 560 nm The percentage of cell viability was calculated using the following formula: Cell viability (%)=Cells number treated/Cells number DMSO control×100. Data was obtained from three independent experiments. [0039] Results: There was no toxicity observed overtly in PC-12 cells treated with Onjisaponin B for 48 hours as revealed by MTT assay as shown in FIG. 2 a. Besides, no significant morphological damage was found in PC12 cells treated with Onjisaponin B for 24 hours as revealed by the crystal violet assay as shown in FIG. 2 b. [0040] Conclusion: The result shows that Onjisaponin B is non-toxic in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells (PC-12). Example 2 [0041] This example describes an in vitro study to demonstrate the autophagic effect of Onjisaponin B. [0042] Quantification of autophagy GFP-LC3 Puncta. GFP-LC3 puncta formation was quantified as described previously [2]. In brief, cells grown on coverslips in a 6-well plate were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature and then rinsed with PBS. Slides were mounted with FluorSave™ mounting media (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The number of GFP-positive cells with GFP-LC3 puncta formation was examined under the Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope. Representative images were captured with CCD digital camera Spot RT3™ (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Melville, N.Y.). To quantify autophagy, the percentage of cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence was calculated by counting the number of the cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence in GFP-positive cells. A minimum of 150 cells from 3 randomly selected fields was scored. [0043] Detection of autophagic marker protein LC3 conversion. After drug treatments with or without autophagy inhibitor (10 g/mL E64D and pepstain A), cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies Inc., Beverly, Mass.). The cell lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins from SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane which was then blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk for 60 minutes. The membrane was then incubated with LC3 primary antibodies (1:1000) in TBST overnight at 4° C. After that, the membrane was further incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 minutes. Finally, protein bands were visualized by using the ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland, UK). [0044] Results: The positive control drug, rapamycin, demonstrated a markedly increase in GFP-LC3 puncta formation. While the other active components of Radix Polygalae including polygalacic acid and senegenin showed no autophagy activity in cells, Onjisaponin B increased the formation of GFP-LC3 puncta formation in a dose dependent manner as revealed by fluorescent microscopy as shown in FIG. 3 a. In addition, western blot analysis of autophagic marker LC3 also demonstrated the increase of LC3-II conversion upon Onjisaponin B treatment as shown in FIG. 3 b. Furthermore, Onjisaponin B increased the rate of LC3-II formation in the presence of protease inhibitors as shown in FIG. 3 c , suggesting that Onjisaponin B induces autophagic flux, rather than promotes the blockage of fusion between autophagosome and lysosome. [0045] Conclusion: These data proved that Onjisaponin B has the autophagic effect and suggested that Onjisaponin B is a novel autophagy enhancer in Radix Polygalae. Example 3 [0046] This example describes an in vitro study to demonstrate the autophagic effect of Onjisaponin B is dependent on the presence of autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7). [0047] Quantification of autophagy GFP-LC3 Puncta in Atg7 wild type and deficient MEFs. GFP-LC3 puncta formation was quantified as described previously [2]. In brief, both Atg7 wild-type and deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) grown on coverslips in a 6-well plate were treated with indicated concentrations of Onjisaponin B. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature and then rinsed with PBS. Slides were mounted with FluorSave™ mounting media (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The number of GFP-positive cells with GFP-LC3 puncta formation was examined under the Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope. Representative images were captured with CCD digital camera Spot RT3™ (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Melville, N.Y.). To quantify for autophagy, the percentage of cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence was calculated by counting the number of the cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence in GFP-positive cells. A minimum of 150 cells from 3 randomly selected fields was scored. [0048] Results: Onjisaponin B was found to induce GFP-LC3 puncta formation in wild type Atg7 cells but not in Atg7-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts as shown in FIG. 4. [0049] Conclusion: The results show that Onjisaponin B works as a novel autophagy enhancer which depends on autophagy related gene, Atg7, for the induction of autophagy. Example 4 [0050] This example describes an in vitro study to demonstrate the molecular mechanism of Onjisaponin B in autophagy induction. [0051] Detection of mTOR signaling marker proteins. PC12 cells treated with indicated time and concentrations of Onjisaponin B were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling). The cell lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins from SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane which was then blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk for 60 minutes. The membrane was then incubated with P-p70S6K, p70S6K, P-AMPK, AMPK primary antibodies (1:1000) in TBST overnight at 4° C. respectively. After that, the membrane was further incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 minutes. Finally, protein bands were visualized by using the ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Invitrogen). [0052] Quantification of Onjisaponin B-mediated autophagy in the presence of specific inhibitors. GFP-LC3 puncta formation was quantified as described previously [2]. In brief, PC12 cells expressing GFP-LC3 were treated with Onjisaponin B (Onji, 25 μM) in the presence of AMPK inhibitor (compound C) (CC, 5 μM) or 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, 5 mM) for 12 hours. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature and then rinsed with PBS. Slides were mounted with FluorSave™ mounting media (Calbiochem) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. To quantify for autophagy, the percentage of cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence was calculated by counting the number of the cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence in GFP-positive cells. A minimum of 150 cells from 3 randomly selected fields was scored. [0053] Results: Onjisaponin B was found to activate the phosphorylation of AMPK in a time dependent manner (as observed from columns 2-4 of FIG. 5 a that show the results of the study in which protein bands of 25 μM Onjisaponin B were visualized at the 8 th , 16 th and 24 th hour) and dose dependent manner (as observed from columns 5-8 of FIG. 5 a that show the results of the study in which protein bands of Onjisaponin B at concentrations of 3 μM, 6.25 μM, 12.5 μM and 25 μM were visualized at the 24 th hour), and this activation was also accompanied by a concomitant reduction in its downstream p70S6K phosphorylation. In addition, there was a significant reduction in Onjisaponin B-induced GFP-LC3 puncta formation in PC12 cells treated with the presence of AMPK inhibitor (compound C) or the autophagy inhibitor (3-Methyladenine,3-MA), which is a specific inhibitor of the class III PI3K responsible for autophagy induction as shown in Fig.Sb. [0054] Conclusion: The results show that Onjisaponin B activates autophagy through an AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. Example 5 [0055] This example describes an in vitro study to demonstrate the clearance of mutant huntingtin and mutant A53T α-synuclein by Onjisaponin B. [0056] Removal of mutant huntingtin and mutant α-synuclein. PC 12 cells were transfected transiently with EGFP-HDQ74 plasmids for 24 hours using Lipofectamine Plus LTX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#39;s protocol. The transfected cells were then treated with Onjisaponin B for 24 hours. The removal of mutant huntingtin, EGFP-HDQ74, was then quantitated by immunoblotting with antibody against EGFP. To measure the clearance of α-synuclein in cellular model, the overexpression of mutant A53T α-synuclein was first induced by the addition of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 24 hours [11], by using the doxycycline inducible PC 12 cell line transfected with A53T α-synuclein plasmid. The expression of mutant A53T α-synuclein was then switched off by removing doxycycline from medium. Cells were then incubated with Onjisaponin B for a further 24 hours. The clearance of mutant α-synuclein was then measured by immunoblotting with antibody against myc tag. [0057] Results: Both ethanol extract of Radix Polygalae and Onjisaponin B enhanced the clearance of overexpressed EGFP-tagged mutant huntingtin with 74 CAG repeats as measured by immunoblotting against EGFP antibody as shown in FIG. 6 a. On the other hand, the expression of A53T α-synuclein can be switched on by adding the chemical agent, doxycycline. Upon the induction by doxycycline, whether specific compounds enhance the clearance of mutant proteins [11, 29, 30] can be evaluated.'.\n",

No. 61/866,045 filed 15 Aug. 2013, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. FIELD OF INVENTION [0002] This invention relates to a novel autophagy enhancer and the use thereof in treating neurodegenerative diseases. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION [0003] Autophagy is a cellular process that involves the formation of an isolated membrane to form double membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) that sequesters the cytoplasmic materials. Followed by fusion of the autophagosome with lysosome to form an autolysosome, all the engulfed materials are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases to recycle intracellular nutrients and energy [1, 2]. Autophagy-lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways are the two major protein degradation pathways in cells [3]. While short-lived nuclear and cytosolic proteins are degraded by proteasomes, large membrane proteins, oligomers and aggregates which cannot pass through the narrow pore of the proteasome barrel are degraded by autophagy [4]. [0004] A variety of neurodegenerative diseases are caused by toxic, aggregate-prone or oligomeric proteins [5-9]. For example, Huntington&#39;s disease (HD) is caused by an over 35 CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion, which results in a long mutant polyQ tract in the huntingtin protein. These polyQ expansions are highly associated with the aggregate formation and toxicity [10, 11]. Autophagy, however, can reduce mutant huntingtin protein levels and its toxicity in cell and mouse models [6, 7]. Parkinson disease (PD) is caused by A53T or A30P α-synuclein mutants, which are identified as substrates of autophagy, and the clearance of these mutant proteins are also highly dependent on autophagy for removal [6-8, 11-14]. Pharmacological activation of autophagy reduces the levels and toxicity of mutant huntingtin, mutant proteins in spinocerebellar ataxia, mutant α-synuclein and mutant tau in either mouse or drosophila models [5, 15]. Furthermore, autophagy-related gene (ATG) knockdown leads to aggregate formation and toxicity in C.elegans [ 16, 17]. In addition to the formation of protein aggregates, the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum, and an increase in the size and number of lipid droplets were observed in ATG gene knockout animal models [14, 18-20]. SUMMARY OF INVENTION [0005] In the light of the foregoing background, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel autophagy enhancer with potential therapeutic application in neurodegenerative diseases by enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, and reduces α-synuclein oligomerization. As a result, the autophagy enhancer is able to recover from mutant huntingtin or α-synuclein-induced neuronal cell death. [0006] In the first aspect, the present invention relates to a method of preventing, treating and/or delaying the onset of neurodegenerative diseases comprising administering an effective amount of Onjisaponin B to a subject in need thereof. [0007] In one embodiment, Onjisaponin B is isolated from Chinese medicinal herbs, Radix Polygalae. [0008] In another embodiment, the neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the buildup of oligomeric proteins comprising mutant huntingtin and mutant α-synuclein. [0009] In yet another embodiment, the neurodegenerative diseases are selected from a group consisting of Parkinson&#39;s disease, and Huntington&#39;s disease. [0010] In another aspect of this invention, a use of Onjisaponin B as an autophagy enhancer for treating neurodegenerative diseases is provided. In one embodiment, Onjisaponin B has been described in the foregoing paragraph(s); in another embodiment, the neurodegenerative diseases have also been described in the foregoing paragraph(s). [0011] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising Onjisaponin B admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier for treating neurodegenerative diseases. In one embodiment, Onjisaponin B has been described in the foregoing paragraph(s); in another embodiment, the neurodegenerative diseases have also been described in the foregoing paragraph(s). [0012] In another aspect, the present invention provides a dietary supplement comprising Onjisaponin B admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier for treating neurodegenerative diseases. In one embodiment, Onjisaponin B has been described in the foregoing paragraph(s); in another embodiment, the neurodegenerative diseases have also been described in the foregoing paragraph(s). [0013] The present invention is based on the identification of novel autophagy enhancer, Onjisaponin B as mentioned above. The invention is also based on the neuroprotective effect of Onjisaponin B on neuronal cells via enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, as well as preventing the oligomerization of α-synuclein. [0014] Onjisaponin B exhibits no significant cytotoxic effect on a rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells (PC 12) up to 100 μM. It is also relatively non-toxic to mouse, rat and human neuronal cells and brain tissues. [0015] Onjisaponin B is a novel autophagy enhancer isolated from Radix Polygalae and has never been reported before. Also, Onjisaponin B is capable of inducing autophagy in cells and animals. [0016] Onjisaponin B-induced autophagy is dependent on autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7); further, Onjisaponin B is capable of inducing autophagy in Atg7-dependent manner [0017] Besides, Onjisaponin B induces autophagy via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Onjisaponin B is capable of inducing autophagy via modulation of AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. [0018] Further, Onjisaponin B enhances the clearance of mutant huntingtin and mutant A53T α-synuclein; further, Onjisaponin B is capable of enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin and mutant A53T α-synuclein. [0019] Onjisaponin B enhances the clearance of mutant huntingtin in autophagy-wild type cells, but not in autophagy-deficient cells; further, Onjisaponin B is capable of enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin through autophagy induction. [0020] Onjisaponin B reduces the oligomerization of α-synuclein; further, Onjisaponin B is capable of reducing the oligomerization of α-synuclein. [0021] Onjisaponin B reduces toxicity in PC-12 cells expressing either mutant huntingtin or mutant A53T α-synuclein; further, Onjisaponin B is capable of recovering from the mutant huntingtin or mutant A53T α-synuclein-mediated toxicity in neuronal cells or tissues. [0022] Onjisaponin B can be developed as novel neuroprotective agents for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

[0033] In this study, novel autophagy enhancers with neuroprotective effects by evaluating their efficacy in enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, and in increasing of cells viability, are identified. Through screening of their library of natural product extracts from the Chinese medicinal herbs, inventors have demonstrated that both ethanol extract of Radix Polygalae and its single component, Onjisaponin B, are able to induce autophagy with potential therapeutic application in neurodegeneration. [0034] The formula, molecular weight and accurate mass of Onjisaponin B are summarized in Table 1 below.

[0036] The following preparations and examples are given to enable those skilled in the art to more clearly understand and to practice the present invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being illustrative and representative thereof. EXAMPLE 1 [0037] This example describes in vitro cytotoxicity of Onjisaponin B in a rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells (PC12). [0038] Cell culture and cytotoxicity assay: The test compound of Onjisaponin B was dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 100 mmol/L and stored at −20° C. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously [28]. PC-12, 4000 cells were seeded on 96-well plates per well. After overnight pre-incubation, the cells were exposed to different concentrations of Onjisaponin B (0.039-100 μmol/L) for 2 days. Subsequently, 10 μL of MTT reagents was added to each well and incubated at 37° C. for 4 hours followed by the addition of 100 μL solubilization buffer (10% SDS in 0.01 mol/L HCl) and overnight incubation. Absorbance at 585 nm was determined from each well the next day. For cell viability assay measured by crystal violet staining, PC-12 cells were incubated in 35 mm disc followed by the addition of Onjisaponin B at the indicated concentrations for 24 hours. The cells were then incubated with crystal violet for 10 minutes followed by a ddH 2 O wash. The stained cells image was captured by CCD digital camera Spot RT3™ under the Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope with 4× magnification. Cell viability was quantified by dissolving the stained cells in 10% acetic acid (200 μL/well). The colorimetric reading of the solute mixture was then determined by spectrophotometer at OD 560 nm The percentage of cell viability was calculated using the following formula: Cell viability (%)=Cells number treated/Cells number DMSO control×100. Data was obtained from three independent experiments. [0039] Results: There was no toxicity observed overtly in PC-12 cells treated with Onjisaponin B for 48 hours as revealed by MTT assay as shown in FIG. 2 a. Besides, no significant morphological damage was found in PC12 cells treated with Onjisaponin B for 24 hours as revealed by the crystal violet assay as shown in FIG. 2 b. [0040] Conclusion: The result shows that Onjisaponin B is non-toxic in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells (PC-12). Example 2 [0041] This example describes an in vitro study to demonstrate the autophagic effect of Onjisaponin B. [0042] Quantification of autophagy GFP-LC3 Puncta. GFP-LC3 puncta formation was quantified as described previously [2]. In brief, cells grown on coverslips in a 6-well plate were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature and then rinsed with PBS. Slides were mounted with FluorSave™ mounting media (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The number of GFP-positive cells with GFP-LC3 puncta formation was examined under the Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope. Representative images were captured with CCD digital camera Spot RT3™ (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Melville, N.Y.). To quantify autophagy, the percentage of cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence was calculated by counting the number of the cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence in GFP-positive cells. A minimum of 150 cells from 3 randomly selected fields was scored. [0043] Detection of autophagic marker protein LC3 conversion. After drug treatments with or without autophagy inhibitor (10 g/mL E64D and pepstain A), cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies Inc., Beverly, Mass.). The cell lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins from SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane which was then blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk for 60 minutes. The membrane was then incubated with LC3 primary antibodies (1:1000) in TBST overnight at 4° C. After that, the membrane was further incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 minutes. Finally, protein bands were visualized by using the ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland, UK). [0044] Results: The positive control drug, rapamycin, demonstrated a markedly increase in GFP-LC3 puncta formation. While the other active components of Radix Polygalae including polygalacic acid and senegenin showed no autophagy activity in cells, Onjisaponin B increased the formation of GFP-LC3 puncta formation in a dose dependent manner as revealed by fluorescent microscopy as shown in FIG. 3 a. In addition, western blot analysis of autophagic marker LC3 also demonstrated the increase of LC3-II conversion upon Onjisaponin B treatment as shown in FIG. 3 b. Furthermore, Onjisaponin B increased the rate of LC3-II formation in the presence of protease inhibitors as shown in FIG. 3 c , suggesting that Onjisaponin B induces autophagic flux, rather than promotes the blockage of fusion between autophagosome and lysosome. [0045] Conclusion: These data proved that Onjisaponin B has the autophagic effect and suggested that Onjisaponin B is a novel autophagy enhancer in Radix Polygalae. Example 3 [0046] This example describes an in vitro study to demonstrate the autophagic effect of Onjisaponin B is dependent on the presence of autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7). [0047] Quantification of autophagy GFP-LC3 Puncta in Atg7 wild type and deficient MEFs. GFP-LC3 puncta formation was quantified as described previously [2]. In brief, both Atg7 wild-type and deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) grown on coverslips in a 6-well plate were treated with indicated concentrations of Onjisaponin B. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature and then rinsed with PBS.

A minimum of 150 cells from 3 randomly selected fields was scored. [0048] Results: Onjisaponin B was found to induce GFP-LC3 puncta formation in wild type Atg7 cells but not in Atg7-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts as shown in FIG. 4. [0049] Conclusion: The results show that Onjisaponin B works as a novel autophagy enhancer which depends on autophagy related gene, Atg7, for the induction of autophagy. Example 4 [0050] This example describes an in vitro study to demonstrate the molecular mechanism of Onjisaponin B in autophagy induction. [0051] Detection of mTOR signaling marker proteins. PC12 cells treated with indicated time and concentrations of Onjisaponin B were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling). The cell lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins from SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane which was then blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk for 60 minutes. The membrane was then incubated with P-p70S6K, p70S6K, P-AMPK, AMPK primary antibodies (1:1000) in TBST overnight at 4° C. respectively. After that, the membrane was further incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 minutes. Finally, protein bands were visualized by using the ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Invitrogen). [0052] Quantification of Onjisaponin B-mediated autophagy in the presence of specific inhibitors. GFP-LC3 puncta formation was quantified as described previously [2]. In brief, PC12 cells expressing GFP-LC3 were treated with Onjisaponin B (Onji, 25 μM) in the presence of AMPK inhibitor (compound C) (CC, 5 μM) or 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, 5 mM) for 12 hours. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature and then rinsed with PBS. Slides were mounted with FluorSave™ mounting media (Calbiochem) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. To quantify for autophagy, the percentage of cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence was calculated by counting the number of the cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence in GFP-positive cells. A minimum of 150 cells from 3 randomly selected fields was scored. [0053] Results: Onjisaponin B was found to activate the phosphorylation of AMPK in a time dependent manner (as observed from columns 2-4 of FIG. 5 a that show the results of the study in which protein bands of 25 μM Onjisaponin B were visualized at the 8 th , 16 th and 24 th hour) and dose dependent manner (as observed from columns 5-8 of FIG. 5 a that show the results of the study in which protein bands of Onjisaponin B at concentrations of 3 μM, 6.25 μM, 12.5 μM and 25 μM were visualized at the 24 th hour), and this activation was also accompanied by a concomitant reduction in its downstream p70S6K phosphorylation. In addition, there was a significant reduction in Onjisaponin B-induced GFP-LC3 puncta formation in PC12 cells treated with the presence of AMPK inhibitor (compound C) or the autophagy inhibitor (3-Methyladenine,3-MA), which is a specific inhibitor of the class III PI3K responsible for autophagy induction as shown in Fig.Sb. [0054] Conclusion: The results show that Onjisaponin B activates autophagy through an AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. Example 5 [0055] This example describes an in vitro study to demonstrate the clearance of mutant huntingtin and mutant A53T α-synuclein by Onjisaponin B. [0056] Removal of mutant huntingtin and mutant α-synuclein. PC 12 cells were transfected transiently with EGFP-HDQ74 plasmids for 24 hours using Lipofectamine Plus LTX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#39;s protocol. The transfected cells were then treated with Onjisaponin B for 24 hours. The removal of mutant huntingtin, EGFP-HDQ74, was then quantitated by immunoblotting with antibody against EGFP. To measure the clearance of α-synuclein in cellular model, the overexpression of mutant A53T α-synuclein was first induced by the addition of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 24 hours [11], by using the doxycycline inducible PC 12 cell line transfected with A53T α-synuclein plasmid. The expression of mutant A53T α-synuclein was then switched off by removing doxycycline from medium. Cells were then incubated with Onjisaponin B for a further 24 hours. The clearance of mutant α-synuclein was then measured by immunoblotting with antibody against myc tag. [0057] Results: Both ethanol extract of Radix Polygalae and Onjisaponin B enhanced the clearance of overexpressed EGFP-tagged mutant huntingtin with 74 CAG repeats as measured by immunoblotting against EGFP antibody as shown in FIG. 6 a. On the other hand, the expression of A53T α-synuclein can be switched on by adding the chemical agent, doxycycline. Upon the induction by doxycycline, whether specific compounds enhance the clearance of mutant proteins [11, 29, 30] can be evaluated.'.\n",

No. 13/641,235 filed Oct. 15, 2012; which is a 371 of International Application PCT/US2011/032674 filed Apr. 15, 2011; which claims benefit of provisional application No. 61/325,200, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD [0002] The present invention relates to an improved method to make dental restorations and dentures, the tools used to make these restorations and dentures and to dental articulators and, more particularly, to an improved articulator which allows for accurate simulation of the jaw or condylar movements of a patient and accurate interchangeability of dental casts. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Currently dentists utilize a set of impression trays to make a mold of the patient&#39;s teeth. This mold is filled will plaster to create a model of the patients teeth. The plaster model of the patient&#39;s teeth is then used by the dentist as a substructure to build either dental crowns or bridges. This model of the upper and lower dental arch is then placed in a dental articulator to allow the dentist or dental technician to make a crown or bridge. A bite transfer or some similar tool is used to align the models in the articulator. Once the upper and lower dental arch models are aligned the bite transfer is discarded. The dental technician then creates the dental restoration, crown or bridge. Once completed, the restoration is returned to the dentist for “try-in” and fitting. This fitting requires the dentist to match the restoration to the patients jaw movements. [0004] For dentures, dentists currently utilize a set of impression trays to capture a mold of the patient&#39;s boney structure or ridge preparation for any dentures the dentist or dental technician make. This mold is filled with plaster, which is used to create a model that is then placed in a dental articulator. The dentist or dental technician will then make an educated guess as to the correct spacing between the models and as to the patients lip line. A set of “try-in” rims are created to test the assumptions made by the dentist and dental technician. The placement of the models in the articulator is then adjusted based on the modifications to the “try-in” rims. A set of “try-in” dentures is made out of wax and “tried-in” the patient&#39;s mouth. If any adjustments are made to this set of dentures, a second try-in is performed. Once these adjustments are complete, the final denture set is made from the try-in set and returned to the Dentist for final try-in and fitting. [0005] The purpose of a dental articulator is to simulate the jaw or condylar movements of a patient. This instrument enables a dentist to obtain the necessary diagnostic information for the treatment of occlusal irregularities, such as malocclusion, and the fabrication of dental casts or “dentures.” [0006] U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,474 (“the Lee Patent”) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,475, disclose a simplified system for measuring jaw movements, and information useful in setting and operating dental articulators. It is further suggested in those patents that plastic guide blocks of the type disclosed in the earlier Lee Patent be classified according to certain characteristics of jaw movements to provide a series of average value blocks from which the pair most closely fitting the measurements of a particular patient&#39;s condylar movements may be selected. Such guide blocks have curved walls which produce movement that closely simulates a patient&#39;s particular condylar movements, thus enabling a dentist to treat accurately an occlusal or denture problem without requiring the presence of the patient. [0007] While these methods have been available for some time, the methods have not accurately and precisely recorded the patent&#39;s particular condylar movements. The methods currently in place fail to record the effects of both the incisal guidance and posterior guidance, in a single record, which are necessary to create a reliable non-linear duplication of the condylar guidance. [0008] Thus there is a need for an economical and simple method to accurately replicate the unique path of motion when performing dental restorations. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] The present invention is directed to an improved method to make dental restorations and dentures. More particularly, the present invention is directed to an improved dental articulator that allows for accurate simulation of the jaw or condylar movements of a patient and accurate interchangeability of dental casts and the use of that improved dental articulator to make dental restorations and dentures. [0010] This process is unique in at least two aspects relating to common dental practice. First, there is an expectation of recording balancing (non-working side) guides for registering the medial wall of the glenoid fossa. Second, all guidance is patient initiated and guided with verbal coaching from clinician encouraging maximal muscular effort. [0011] In the present invention, an improved dental articulator is described. The dental articulator includes: an upper frame and a lower frame for simulating the lower dental arch and the upper dental arch; one of the frames having a pair of condyle mounted thereon; a pair of removable condylar tables mounted on the other of the frames; a malleable material deposited in the condylar tables; an incisal pin mounted to one of the frames; a removable anterior guide table; and a malleable material deposited in the anterior guide table [0012] In accordance with another aspect of this invention, a method of recording three-dimensional jaw movements and transferring the record to an improved dental articulator is provided. This method, which can be used to make dental restorations, includes the steps of: producing a standard impression of a patient&#39;s dentition; recording the functional dynamics of occlusion using impression material by having the patient perform an immediate lateral move, requesting the patient to bite back with strenuous force in right and left directions to produce a functionally generated path (“FGP”) record; taking measurements using a bite plate; producing a standard model of the patient&#39;s upper dental arch and lower dental arch; placing the model of the upper arch and lower arch in the improved articulator utilizing the condylar and anterior guide setup boxes; placing the FGP record in the articulator; placing condylar and anterior guide tables in the improved articulator, the condylar and anterior guide table filled with a malleable material; manipulating the model of the upper dental arch and the lower dental arch to scribe a path into the malleable material; and removing the FGP record and allowing malleable material to harden. [0013] In accordance with another aspect of this invention, a method of recording three-dimensional jaw movements in an edentulous patient and transferring the record to the improved dental articulator is provided. This method can be used to make dentures and includes the steps of: producing a standard impression of a patient&#39;s upper and lower jaw bone forms; placing a Vertical Dimension of Occlusion (“VDO”) tool in the patient&#39;s mouth to measure the intraoral spacing between the upper and lower jaw and the lip line; attaching a spacing rim to the VDO with impression material placed on the top and bottom rear surface to the spacing rim, and placing the VDO and spacing rim in the patients mouth to record the rear spacing of the patients upper and lower jaw; placing the model of the upper arch and lower arch in the improved dental articulator utilizing the VDO and spacing rim to set the correct intraoral spacing of the upper and lower models, utilizing the condylar and anterior guide setup boxes; creating a set of Eric&#39;s rims in the improved articulator utilizing the individual patients articulation setup; Eric&#39;s rims are placed into the patients mouth to recorded the functional dynamics of occlusion by having the patient perform severally lateral moves, requesting the patient to bite back with strenuous force in right and left directions to produce a FGP record; removing the Eric&#39;s rims from the patient&#39;s mouth and using the marks indicated on the Eric&#39;s rims material is removed; returning the Eric&#39;s rims to the patient&#39;s mouth and repeating the process until the Eric&#39;s rims are fully balanced; placing the Eric&#39;s rims back into the improved articulator; placing condylar and anterior guide tables in the improved articulator, the condylar and anterior guide table filled with a malleable material; manipulating the model and Erie&#39;s rims of the upper dental arch and the lower dental arch to scribe a path into the malleable material; removing Eric&#39;s rims record and allowing malleable material to harden; and making a temporary denture of wax utilizing an improved functionally balanced Posterior Guided Occlusion teeth, that matches curve of Eric&#39;s rims and the benefits of the improved dental articulator. [0014] The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the invention, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying Figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that each of the Figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0015] For a more complete understanding of the present invention, reference is now made to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying Figures and drawings, in which: [0016] FIG. 1 shows improved dental articulator with model. [0017] FIG. 2 shows an exploded view of the improved dental articulator. [0018] FIG. 3 shows a side view Vertical Dimension of Occlusion with Lip Line Tab. [0019] FIG. 4 shows a side view of the Eric&#39;s Rim. [0020] FIG. 5 shows the condylar table set-up box [0021] FIG. 6 shows the condylar table box. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0022] As used herein, “a” or “an” means one or more than one. [0023] The methods and apparatus of the present invention will now be illustrated with reference to FIGS. 1 through 4. It should be understood, that these are merely illustrative and not exhaustive examples of the scope of the present invention and that variations which are understood by those having ordinary skill in the art are within the scope of the present invention. [0024] Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2 , an example of an improved dental articulator is shown. The dental articulator is used to hold models of the upper dental arch 127 and the lower dental arch 137 and simulate the movement of the jaw when fabricating dental restorations such as crowns, bridges, and dentures. [0025] The dental articulator has an upper frame 120 , and lower frame 130 used to mount the model of the upper dental arch 127 and the model of the lower dental arch 137. The model of the upper dental arch 127 is held to the arm 121 of upper frame 120 by a conventional mounting plate 122 and the model of the lower dental arch 137 is held to the arm 131 of lower frame 130 by a conventional mounting plate 132. Both models are attached to the mounting plates using plaster or other material. In the preferred embodiment, both mounting plates 132 and 142 are held to the articulator by a snapping feature or magnetic feature designed into the mounting plate; however, other securing mechanisms, such as screws and the like, are envisioned. The position of the upper dental arch 127 is adjusted by adding material to area 124 between the upper dental arch 127 and mounting plate 122. Similarly, the position of the lower dental arch 137 is adjusted by adding material to area 134 between the lower dental arch 137 and mounting plate 132. [0026] The dental articulator has a pair of posts 150 with condyles 151. Condyle 151 tit with condylar table 160 to simulate the temporal mandible joint of the patient. The condyle can be any shape the can be used to accurately represent the motion of the of the patients jaw. However, in the preferred embodiment, a spherical shaped condyle is used. [0027] The condylar table 160 of the present invention consists of a removable box that is connected to the dental articulator. As shown in FIG. 6 , condylar table 160 includes an open box 161. The open box 161 allows a malleable material to be placed inside the box as well as to allow condyle 151 to enter the condylar table 161. The malleable material can be any self curing material such as methyl methacrylate, two part epoxy, urethane, sodium alginate, agar, condensation-cured silicones, and addition-cured silicones such as polyvinyl siloxane, wax or similar material. The setup condylar table is similar to the removable condylar table, however the box is not open, but instead includes an indentation to receive the condyle 151. The setup anterior guide table is similar to the removable anterior guide table; however the box is not open, but instead includes an indentation to receive the Incisal Pin 170. The setup condylar tables and the anterior guide table are removed and saved for future use. [0028] Dental articulator also has an incisal pin 170 and incisal table 171. Incisal pin 170 is utilized to set the normal distance between the upper dental arch 127 and the lower dental arch 137. The incisal table 171 consists of a removable box that is connected to the dental articulator. Like the condylar table 161 , the front of the box is open to allow the same malleable material as used in the condylar table 161 to be placed inside the box. This allows the incisal pin 170 to enter the incisal table 171. [0029] Additionally, a removable set-up condylar tables and set-up incisal tables are used with the improved dental articulator. FIG. 5 shows a typical set-up table 600. The incisal pin 170 is held in place in the arm 121 by a set screw 173. The set-up table typically is a closed box or block that prevents the condyle 151 or incisal pin 170 from completely entering the box. The setup tables may also include an indentation 601 that allows the condyle 151 or incisal pin 170 to rest. This allows the dentist or dental technician to set the upper and lower arch in stable in a stable occlusal position before condylar table 160 and incisal table 170 are placed in the improved articulator. [0030] The improved dental articulator can be used to make dental restorations and dentures. The procedure for using the improved dental articulator is described in further detail below. [0031] Generally, the improved dental articulator can be used to make dental restorations, such as crowns and bridges, using the following steps: preparing the teeth for restoration; making an impression of the teeth; recording the jaw movements of a patient to produce a functional generated path (“FGP”) record; producing the upper and lower model of the teeth; transferring the FGP record to the improved dental articulator to produce a model of the jaw movements; and reproducing the jaw movements in the articulator to create a custom condylar table. Each of these steps will be discussed in detail below. [0032] While the following describes the method of the present invention for the restoration of a tooth, specifically the preparation of a crown, those skilled in the art will understand that this method can be applied to any dental restoration procedure and is particularly useful in restorations involving multiple teeth or restorations where a terminal tooth is missing. [0033] Typically the first step in applying the present invention requires the preparing the tooth for the restoration. Generally the preparation of a tooth for a crown involves the irreversible removal of a significant amount of tooth structure. When preparing a tooth for a crown, typically, the enamel is totally removed and the finished preparation is, thus, entirely dentin. The amount of tooth structure required to be removed will depend on the material(s) being used to restore the tooth. For example, if porcelain is applied to a gold crown, the total tooth is reduced minimally 1.5 mm. [0034] After the tooth is prepared, a standard impression of the dentition is made, allowing accurate models of the teeth to be made later. An impression is carried out by placing a liquid material into the mouth in a customized tray. The material then sets to become an elastic solid, and when removed from the mouth retains the shape of the teeth. Common materials used for dental impressions include, but are not limited to, sodium alginate, agar, condensation-cured silicones, and addition-cured silicones such as polyvinyl siloxane. [0035] When crowns or bridges are made using this technique, the complex relationship that defines the functional dynamics of occlusion is recorded using a thermoplastic transfer material in a bite plate. The bite plate has a tongue and record area. The thermoplastic transfer material located in record area (re-enforced wax, compound material, or Thermacryl) is warmed to a plastic state, adapted to the prepared teeth, and the FGP registration is recorded. [0036] Unlike the standard “chew-in” procedure, the method of this invention uses a modified procedure with more aggressive mastication used to generate the FGP record. Specifically, the patient or subject is coached into an immediate lateral move and then asked to bite back with strenuous force in right and left directions.'.\n",

      "Changed 'pump' by '60' in 'FIELD [0001] The invention refers to a ventricular assist device for intraventricular placement to accelerate blood flow inside a human heart thereby enhancing the ejecting volume, comprising an anchor element configured to be mounted to the heart in the region of the apex and a pump connected to the anchor element and comprising a preferably tubular housing having an inlet and an outlet and further comprising a drive for driving a rotor arranged within the housing and a special adjustable nozzle directing the ejecting blood flow. BACKGROUND [0002] Left ventricular contractility normally accelerates blood within the left ventricle and ejects as an average 70% of the blood volume contained in the left ventricle into the circulatory system. In case of severe heart failure this mechanism is insufficient and the majority of the blood volume remains within the ventricle, thus producing inadequate cardiac output. [0003] Several systems are known to correct cardiac failure bypassing the left ventricle and continuously ejecting the blood from the left ventricle via an artificial conduit directly into the great thoracic arteries. Such systems operate as left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) in order to help the heart&#39;s weakened left ventricle pump blood throughout the body. [0004] The LVAD can be used as a bridge-to-transplant, which means it can help a patient survive until a donor heart becomes available for transplant. This option may be appropriate for people whose medical therapy has failed acutely and/or who are hospitalized with end-stage systolic heart failure. The LVAD also can be used as destination therapy, which is an alternative to heart transplantation. Destination therapy provides long-term support in patients who are not candidates for transplant, because of severe comorbidities and especially of older age. When used as a bridge-to-transplant or as destination therapy, the LVAD provides effective chronic hemodynamic support, maintains or improves other organ function, improves exercise performance and enables participation in cardiac rehabilitation. [0005] These assist devices comprise a continuous flow pump, which produces a continuous, non-pulsatile flow of blood through the circulatory system using a rotary pumping mechanism. There is, however, a multitude of side effects on end organs as well as major cardiac surgery for implantation. Recently several minimal invasive forms of cardiac assist devices have been developed. WO 2009/099644 A1 discloses a ventricular assist device for intraventricular placement inside a human heart. It comprises a pump that is implanted within the left ventricle with the outflow cannula projecting through the aortic valve and terminating short of the aortic arch. The pump is fixed to the wall of the heart near the apex by means of an anchor element in order to hold the pump and the outflow cannula in position. The device disclosed in WO 2009/099644 A1 produces a continuous flow of blood, wherein the aortic valve is penetrated by the outflow cannula and is therefore unable to close effectively, but cooperates with the pump traversing it in order to prevent retrograde flow of blood into the left ventricle during diastole. Because of the continuous character of the flow the valve is held in only one position, which increases the risk of valve thrombosis and/or significant retrograde leakage into the failing and assisted ventricle. [0006] The drawback of the device disclosed in WO 2009/099644 A1 and of other continuous flow ventricular assist devices is that—since they have to maintain up to 100% of cardiac output—they are disturbing normal end organ function and contractile pattern of the diseased heart, leaving nutritive coronary blood flow unchanged and therefore limit structural recovery. SUMMARY [0007] Therefore, it is an object of the instant invention to provide an improved ventricular assist device for intraventricular placement inside a human heart. In particular, it is an object of the invention to optimize blood flow and support residual contractility without the severe side effects of continuous flow as mentioned above. In particular, it is an object of the invention to provide an implant that does not involve the risk of impairing the remaining contractile force of the failing ventricle. [0008] Further, it is an object of the invention to avoid the drawbacks associated with LVAD systems having extraventricular conduits. In available LVAD systems with external conduits the aortic valve remains closed, because all ejecting blood is bypassed. Therefore, the system is limited only to patients without a structural insufficient aortic valve. [0009] It is a further object of the invention to provide an assist device that can be easily deployed to the heart without a sternotomy. [0010] It is a further object of the invention to provide a closed loop between the circulatory demand, the remaining force of the diseased ventricle and the supporting pump. [0011] The words “proximal” and “distal” are used herein to denote directions and ends of the device in relation to blood flow. As used herein, when referring to the ventricular assist device, the term “proximal” refers also to the directions toward the physiologic blood flow and surgeon or other operating room personnel during installation of the device and the term “distal” has the opposite meaning. [0012] The invention generally provides an improved ventricular assist device for intraventricular placement (inside a human heart) providing pulsatile flow acceleration in the left ventricle, preferably during systole. Preferably, the pulsatile flow acceleration is synchronized with the heartbeat. [0013] In some embodiments, the invention provides ventricular assist device comprising an anchor element configured to be mounted to the heart in the region of the apex and a pump connected to the anchor element and comprising a preferably tubular housing having an inlet and an outlet, said inlet and said outlet being arranged within the ventricle, and further comprising a drive for driving a rotor arranged within the housing. Preferably, the drive is an electric or pneumatic motor. [0014] In some embodiments, in order to provide pulsatile flow acceleration during systole, the invention provides a control unit connected with the drive for controlling the pump, said control unit comprising a first sensor for sensing a heartbeat of the heart and configured to control the pump to be driven in a pulsatile manner in synchronization with the heartbeats. [0015] The invention is based on the idea to correct left ventricular failure by increasing the velocity of the blood column during the ejecting period of the heart (i.e. during cardiac systole) and redirecting blood flow within the ventricle towards the aortic valve. Normally, blood entering the left ventricle via the mitral valve swirls in a vortex near the apex and gets accelerated during the ejection period. In case of heart failure the heart does not provide enough acceleration of ventricular blood flow, thereby forming a second vortex in the mid cavity without producing sufficient force to eject blood. The inventive device assists the heart by providing a flow accelerator within the ventricle. Thus, the inventive approach uses a different pathophysiologic concept than disclosed in WO 2009/099644 A1. Instead of sucking the blood out of the ventricle continuously and directly delivering the pumped blood to the aorta, the invention just assists the heart in its natural way of functioning. [0016] Further, the invention does neither traverse nor bridge the aortic valve, but uses the aortic valve as in an unassisted, healthy heart. [0017] Further, the device does not provide continuous blood flow, but pulsatile blood flow. Pulsatile flow is a flow with periodic variations, like the flow in the cardiovascular system. By synchronizing the pulsatile flow provided by the pump of the assist device with the heartbeat, the periodic variations of the flow produced by the assist device preferably are substantially in phase with the periodic variations of the flow in the cardiovascular system, in particular at the beginning of the aorta. [0018] Preferably, the assist device produces a pulsatile flow by causing alternating phases of no pumping action and of pumping action. Alternatively, the assist device produces a pulsatile flow by causing alternating phases of low pumping action and of enforced pumping action. Thus, the control unit of the assist device is configured to alternately turn on and turn off the pump in order to produce periodic variations of the blood flow within the pump housing. Preferably, the pumping action is triggered only during the early phase of systole until peak pressures are reached within the aorta. Preferably the pump action is initiated by applying a ramp function thereby accelerating the rotor and then leaves the rotor fading out according to the blood volume sensed in the heart at late diastole. [0019] The assist device of the invention is configured to be implanted into the apical region of the heart. [0020] According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the pump is configured as an axial-flow pump in order to pump blood from the inlet of the pump housing to the outlet. [0021] In order to increase the effect of flow acceleration within the ventricle, the device is preferably configured to additionally operate as an injector so as to entrain blood from within the ventricle downstream of said pump rotor, namely entraining blood that is outside of and preferably distal to the pump housing. Preferably, the injector effect of the assist device is achieved by the blood flow produced by the rotor between the inlet and the outlet of the pump housing, which blood flow entrains additional blood from within the ventricle to the aortic valve. In order to allow for said entraining of additional blood, the pump housing preferably comprises at least one additional inlet opening downstream of the rotor. [0022] The injector effect of the pump may preferably also be achieved by beveling the outlet opening of the pump housing so as to obtain an end face that is inclined relative to the axis of the pump. [0023] Preferably, the flow cross-section of the pump continuously decreases in a flow direction at the outflow end of the pump housing so as to form a nozzle. Preferably, the nozzle is able to direct the flow towards the aortic valve and to entrain surrounding blood by sucking it into the nozzle through at least one lateral opening. The nozzle enhances the injector effect of the pump. [0024] Preferably, the nozzle comprises guide plates extending in the axial direction of the pump so as to redirect rotating blood flow exiting the impeller to induce an axially directed laminar blood flow. [0025] Preferably, the end region of the pump housing, downstream of the rotor, is configured to allow for an adjustment of the outflow direction of the pumped blood. In particular, the end region of the pump housing may be flexible to optimize the flow direction towards the outflow of the heart so as to prevent jet-induced lesions on the myocardium. In this way, the flow of blood exiting the pump housing via the outlet opening can be directed to the aortic valve and then fixed in the adjusted position. Preferably, the adjustment of the outflow direction of the pump is feasible in the implanted state of the device. [0026] Preferably, the adjustable end region of the pump housing cooperates with an actuator in order to adjust the outflow direction of the pump. The actuator may be realized by an electric motor and may be positioned outside of the heart. When positioned outside of the heart, the actuator is preferably connected to the adjustable end region of the pump housing by means of suitable connecting means, such as a steering wire. The adjusting movement of the adjustable end region of the pump housing as induced by the actuator is preferably controlled under the guidance of a blood flow monitoring technique. Preferably, the actuator is controlled by a continuous flow sensor incorporated into the adjustable end region so as to position the adjustable end region of the pump housing into the optimal position within the outflow tract. Periodic monitoring of the orientation of the adjustable end region of the housing is advantageous for an optimal ejection of blood from the failing heart into the aorta, since the heart remodels during therapy. [0027] Preferably, the outflow orientation of the pump is adjusted automatically, by using a control algorithm, in particular a closed loop controller. Preferably, the outflow direction of the pump is controlled as a function of the blood flow speed measured in the vicinity of the outflow end of the pump. The blood flow speed is indicative of whether the blood flow is directed to the aortic valve or whether the blood flow induced by the pump is reflected at the heart wall surrounding the aortic valve or into the inflow region. The flow speed may be measured by means of an ultrasonic Doppler sensor that is mounted at the outflow end of the pump. Preferably, the further parameters to be considered in the control algorithm are at least one of hemodynamic variables such as hemodynamic pressure, pump speed, energy consumption and hemodynamic pressure. [0028] According to another preferred embodiment, the pump comprises a magnetic coupling for coupling a drive, in particular a rotary drive, to the rotor. The magnetic coupling provides a non-contact and wearless transmission of the rotary motion of the drive to the rotor. Further, the magnetic coupling facilitates the removal of the drive and the mounting of a new drive if needed. [0029] Preferably, the drive is an electric motor. Alternatively, the drive may be configured as a pneumatic drive, so that the rotor of the pump is driven by pneumatic force. Preferably, the pneumatic drive is located outside the heart, wherein the magnetic coupling allows a complete separation between the drive and the pump rotor. In this embodiment the pneumatic energy is delivered by a percutaneous tube connected with a pneumatic source delivering pulsed volume flows into the turbine positioned outside of the heart, which is magnetically coupled to the blood pumping impeller. [0030] Preferably, the drive is at least partially arranged proximally of the anchor element so as to be placed at least partially outside of the heart when in use. In particular, the entire drive is arranged outside of the heart when in use. In case of an electric motor, this helps to keep away the heat generated by the electric motor from the ventricle and the blood contained therein so as to reduce the risk of a thrombosis. [0031] Alternatively, the motor may be positioned intraventricularly. Preferably, the pump rotor may be directly coupled to the rotor of the electric motor, wherein the rotor is supported within the motor by means of a contactless magnetic bearing. In this way, the magnetic bearing provides for an annular clearance between the rotor and the stator of the electric motor, the clearance establishing a flow cross-section for the blood pumped by the pump rotor. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 3,436,570. [0032] According to another preferred embodiment, the pump output of the pump, i.e. the rotational speed of the pump rotor, and/or the activation time period of the pump are adjusted depending on the patient&#39;s level of activity and need of support. Preferably, the control unit is configured to control the rotational speed of the pump rotor as a function of heart rate signals derived from the first sensor. In particular, the rotational speed of the pump rotor is increased with increasing heart rate in order to compensate for the reduction of the ejection period. [0033] Further, the rotational speed of the pump rotor is decreased with decreasing heart rate. [0034] According to another preferred embodiment, the pump output of the pump is varied over a heartbeat cycle, such that a maximum pump output is reached during the systolic period, wherein a lower output is adjusted in order to augment the pressure during diastole when needed to facilitate coronary inflow. Preferably, a second sensor is needed to control the driving speed of the pump rotor to avoid cavitation within the heart, so that the pump accelerates only the equivalent volume portion needed in order to achieve normal ventricular ejection. [0035] Alternatively or additionally, the control unit may comprise at least a further sensor for sensing a blood pressure, a cardiac output, a blood flow velocity, a derivative of the blood pressure and/or a pulse wave velocity and is configured to control the rotational speed of the pump rotor as a function of the signals derived from the further sensor. The blood pressure sensor may preferably be configured as a noninvasive blood pressure measuring device, in particular as a device operating according to continuous noninvasive techniques. The pulse wave velocity is preferably measured by a method for continuous pulse wave monitoring, such as identifying a time difference between a signal derived from the ECG and the corresponding signal measured at the patient&#39;s arm or other extremity by a non-invasive blood pressure measuring method. [0036] Preferably, the control unit comprises a memory for storing at least one characteristic curve representing a set value for a blood pressure as a function of the heart rate. The control unit may in this case be configured to calculate a pressure difference between a blood pressure derived from the further sensor and a set value for the blood pressure derived from the characteristic curve and to control the rotational speed of the pump rotor as a function of said pressure difference. [0037] Adapting the activation time period of the pump may be used in order to adjust the ejection time of the diseased heart to that of a healthy heart. This may alter the ejection and heart rate relationship according to the values registered by the further sensor(s). [0038] As mentioned above, the further sensor may be configured to sense the cardiac output. In order to sense the cardiac output, the further sensor may be configured to measure the volume of the heart cavity, such as a sensor arranged for measuring the impedance across the heart. In particular, the ratio of the diastolic volume of the heart to the systolic volume of the heart per heartbeat or unit of time may be used in order to calculate cardiac output. The control unit may use the data representing cardiac output as sensed by the further sensor in order to adapt the rotational speed of the pump rotor in a close loop control.'.\n",

      "Changed '10' by 'grip' in 'FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an isolated material which generally reduces organ mass, and to its therapeutic use. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The mammalian gonads secrete a variety of hormones, such as oestrogen and testosterone, and other signalling molecules, such as growth factors and cytokines, which have effects throughout the body. Mechanisms regulating the masses of tissues and organs can in their totality be described as the “organotrophic system”. The endocrine (hormonal) contribution to this system includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, the adrenals, the thyroid and other endocrine tissues. Among the generally positive endocrine influences in the organotrophic system are oestrogen and testosterone. Organotrophic effects of oestrogens are discussed by Hart, Pharmac. Ther. (1990) 47:203-218. Hart, Toxicology (1990) 61:185-194, reported that the oestrogen antagonist, clomiphene, could decrease most organ weights in female rats. Hart postulated that clomiphene may act as an antagonist of the known positive organotrophic oestrogen effect. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the discovery of an endogenous material (described herein as “micrin”) which can diminish the size and weight of many organs and tissues throughout the body. Micrin can be obtained by a process which comprises: (i) treating a female mammal with clomiphene citrate (this step is optional); (ii) collecting ovarian venous blood from the mammal; (iii) preparing ovarian venous plasma from the blood collected in step (ii); and (iv) at least partially purifiying micrin from the ovarian venous plasma. Micrin may be defined as an endogenous material which is inducible by clomiphene and has the effect in general of reducing organ or tissue mass in a mammalian body. Micrin may be a single compound or a group of compounds. Micrin has a molecular weight range of nominally 10-20 kD when purified from blood as defined herein although it is possible that it is a larger or smaller moiety having physico-chemical properties which cause it to behave as if it were a moiety of 10-20 kD. Further, it is possible that the active component is of lower molecular weight through its being associated (covalently, or more likely non-covalently) with a carrier, or by being a fragment of the micrin that has been identified, or that the 10-20 kD moiety is a biologically active fragment of a larger entity. Without wishing to be bound by theoretical considerations, it is believed that micrin is a newly discovered hormone produced principally by mammalian gonads, although other sources of the hormone are contemplated. This is the first time that a hormone with widespread negative influence on organ size has been discovered. Indeed there existed a technical prejudice in the art, away from the presence invention, which believed there were mainly positive endocrine influences on organ size; organ shrinkage being presumed to be brought about by absence of a positive factor (such as for example pituitary trophic hormones). This invention introduces a novel entity (micrin) which is generally a negative influence on organ size (although individual organs may respond differently). The mechanism of action of micrin is not yet understood. It may involve one or more of cell shrinkage, inhibition of cell division and an increased effect in apoptosis, or micrin may be associated with a substance having such effects. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 1 to 5 each show the results of bioassays, versus controls, of the effect of micrin, at various stages of isolation, on the weights of various organs. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION With reference to the four-step process defined above, step (iv) preferably comprises obtaining the 10-30 kD molecular weight fraction from ovarian venous plasma, for example by membrane filtration. More preferably, step (iv) comprises obtaining the 10-20 kD molecular weight fraction from ovarian venous plasma, for example by gel filtration chromatography. Most preferably, step (iv) further comprises subjecting the 10-20 kD fraction to further purification by ion exchange chromatography and collecting the fraction eluted in 0.1-0.2 M NaCl. The procedure is fully described in the Examples, below. The following Protocol and Flow Diagram are summaries: Protocol 1. Plasma cleared by centrifugation at +4° C. and 4000 rpm for 5 minutes. 2. Cleared plasma spun through Amicon Centriprep-30 cartridges at 2000 rpm to give a nominal 0-30 kD fraction. 3. Nominal 0-30 kD fraction spun through Amicon Centriprep-10 to give a nominal 10-30 kD sub-fraction. 4. Nominal 10-30 kD sub-fraction concentrated and gel filtered through a Pharmacia FPLC Superdex-75 column to give a nominal 10-20 kD sub-fraction. 5. Nominal 10-20 kD sub-fraction repeatedly concentrated and buffer diluted and applied to a Pharmacia FPLC Mono-Q ion exchange column eluted with a gradient of 0-0.3 M NaCl. Eluate divided into 0-0.1 M, 0.1-0.2 M and 0.2-0.3 M NaCl ion exchange fractions.

These include physico-chemical methods, such as HPLC, FPLC, gel filtration, electrophoresis, column chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, isoelectric focusing, or using immuno-affinity columns. The presence of micrin at any stage can be confirmed by the bioassay reported below, as Example 3. Micrin may also exist in other fractions than those obtained by the recited steps, but its effect is generally less in such other fractions. Micrin-rich plasma may be obtained from a suitable mammal such as a sheep. For example, the sheep (approximately 70 kg) is treated with clomiphene citrate at 1.5 g/day on Day 3 post-oestrus of its reproductive cycle and the following 3 days, as described herein. Depending on factors such as the age of the sheep, clomiphene induction may be unnecessary. Preferably, the micrin, e.g. obtained by the given procedure, has a specific activity of at least 1 unit/ml. A unit of micrin is defined as an amount of micrin which when administered daily is sufficient to decrease the relative (post-exsanguination) organ weight of the female rat heart by 5% when administered in 4 equal daily doses using the bioassay described herein. Micrin has therapeutic utility. In particular, it may be used for the treatment of organ or tissue hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia in a mammal. Specific conditions that may be treated include, for example, cardiac or prostatic hypertrophy, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis polycystic renal disease and pituitary adenoma. For this purpose, it may be used in the form obtained by extraction or further purification, as described above, or it may be formulated, as a medicament. Thus, according to another aspect of the present invention, a pharmaceutical composition comprises micrin and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier. A preferred pharmaceutical composition is suitable for parenteral administration such as, for example, an injectable solution, preferably sterile. Other suitable non-injectable methods of administration, for which micrin may be formulated as appropriate, are oral and nasal. Suitable carriers and excipients, and other suitable additives, are known to those skilled in the art. For example, a micrin solution may be prepared in a sterile form using any suitable technique such as for example sterile filtration. The dosage to be administered can be determined, having regard to typical factors, by one skilled in the art. A suitable dosage is 1-25 ml/day of micrin having a specific activity of about 1 unit/ml. A preferred dosage is 2.5-10 ml/day and especially 5 ml/day. Micrin may also be used as a research tool for exploring a novel mammalian micrin hormone system and/or the organotrophic system. It may also be used to screen for agonists or antagonists of micrin such as, for example, by mixing a potential agonist or antagonist compound with the partially purified micrin described herein and measuring differences in the bioassay described herein compared with appropriate controls. Micrin may also be used as a surrogate marker in clinical trials, to screen potential drugs for undesirable toxicological properties on the micrin hormonal system as detectable in the bioassay described herein, and to detect effects on the wider organotrophic system. The following Examples illustrate the invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: FIG. 1 illustrates a bioassay (n=10) of test ovarian venous plasma from a clomiphene-treated sheep (“active plasma”) in the female rat versus a control of jugular venous plasma from an ovariectomised (“ovx”) sheep, untreated with clomiphene; FIG. 2 illustrates the bioassay (n=11) of a 10-30 kD fraction of active plasma in the female rat versus a control of a 10-30 kD fraction of ovx sheep venous plasma; FIG. 3 illustrates the bioassay (n=8) of a 10-20 kD subfraction of active plasma in the female rat versus a control (n=5) of a 10-20 kD sub-fraction of ovx sheep venous plasma; FIG. 4 illustrates the bioassay (n 5) of a 0.1-0.2 M NaCl ion exchange fraction (“active ion exchange fraction”) of the 10-20 kD sub-fraction of active plasma in the female rat versus a control (n=20) of physiological, pyrogen-free saline; and FIG. 5 illustrates the bioassay (n=5) of the active ion exchange fraction in the male rat versus a control of a 0.1-0.2 M NaCl ion exchange fraction of the 10-20 kD sub-fraction of ovx sheep venous plasma. The data in the Figures were obtained thus: the mean relative (post-exsanguination) organ weights of the test rats were first expressed as a percentage of the control means. These figures were then subtracted from 100 to yield the percentage difference between test and control means, the results being plotted against a zero baseline representing control values. The asterisks in the Figures represent the statistical significance, thus: *=p&lt;0.05, **=p&lt;0.02, ***=p&lt;0.01, ****=p&lt;0.002, *****=p&lt;0.001. The statistical analysis involved Student&#39;s t-test. EXAMPLE 1 PREPARATION OF MICRIN 1. Isolation of Sheep Ovarian Venous Plasma Multiparous non-pregnant ewes were used. Ewes were housed with a vasectomised ram to detect the day of oestrus (day 0). On day 3, post-oestrus ewes were injected intramuscularly with clomiphene citrate (Sigma Chemical Co., Poole, UK, catalogue no. C6272) at a dose of 1.5 g/day, dissolved in warm physiological, pyrogen-free saline to a final volume of 10 ml. Clomiphene injections were repeated on days 4, 5 and 6 post-oestrus. On day 6, post-oestrus and under pentobarbitone (RMB Animal Health Ltd., Dagenham, UK) anaesthesia, ovarian venous blood was collected from the sheep, following the method of Heap et al, J. Reprod. Fert. (1985) 74:645-656, into heparin (1 i.u./ml blood) (C.P. Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Wrexham, UK) to prevent clotting. Blood samples were immediately placed on ice until centrifugation. The ovarian venous plasma was then obtained from the ovarian venous blood by centrifugation at +4° C. and 4000 rpm for 20 minutes. The plasma layer was then removed and stored in a plastic bottle in a freezer at −10° C. 2. Preparation of the Nominal 0-30 kD Molecular Weight Fraction from sheep ovarian Plasma The plasma (from 1 above) was cleared by centrifugation at +4° C. and 4000 rpm for 5 minutes. The cleared plasma fraction was then poured into an Amicon Centriprep-30, a centrifuge device with concentric inner and outer compartments separated by a membrane having a nominal cut off size of 30 kD. The device was spun at 2000 rpm for 2 hours at +4° C. The filtrate that had collected in the inner compartment was removed by pipetting and the centrifugation continued for a further 2 hours. This procedure was repeated a further two times after which the inner compartment with the membrane was replaced. The series of centrifugations was then repeated. By this means, 20 ml of filtrate, the nominal 0-30 kD fraction, was obtained from the plasma fraction. The nominal 0-30 kD fraction was stored in a plastic bottle at −10° C. or used in 3 below. 3. Preparation of the Nominal 10-30 kD Molecular Weight Sub-Fraction from Sheep Ovarian Plasma The nominal 0-30 kD plasma fraction, from 2 above, was poured into an Amicon Centriprep-10, having a nominal cut off size 10 kD. The device was spun at 2000 rpm for one hour at +4° C. The filtrate that had collected in the inner compartment was removed by pipetting and the procedure was repeated until approximately 2 ml of sample remained in the outer compartment. This was diluted to 15 ml with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the centrifugation repeated until the volume in the outer compartment was reduced to approximately 2 ml. The resultant fraction, the nominal 10-30 kD sub-fraction, was stored in a plastic bottle at −10° C. or used in 4 below. 4. Preparation of the Nominal 10-20 kD Molecular Weight Sub-Fraction from Sheep Ovarian Plasma The nominal 10-30 kD plasma sub-fraction, from 3 above, was then concentrated to 800 μl with an Amicon Centricon-10, a small centrifuge device fitted with a membrane having a nominal cut off of 10 kD, by spinning in a centrifuge at 2000 rpm for one hour. 200 μl aliquots were then applied to an FPLC gel filtration column (Pharmacia Superdex-75, HR 10/30, 30 cm long, 1 cm diameter) that had been calibrated with protein molecular weight standard. Elution was carried out with 25 ml PBS over a period of 25 minutes and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. Fractions falling within the nominal 10-20 kD molecular weight range were pooled, to give the nominal 10-20 kD sub-fraction, and stored in a plastic bottle at −10° C. or used in 5 below. 5. Preparation of the Three Ion-Exchange (Sodium Chloride) Fractions from the Nominal 10-20 kD Sub-Fraction of Sheep Ovarian Plasma The nominal 10-20 kD molecular weight sub-fraction of sheep ovarian plasma, from 4 above, was concentrated by centrifugation in an Amicon Centricon-3 (5 ml down to 1 ml). The concentrated fraction was subjected to buffer exchange with 20 mM Tris.HCl buffer, pH 7, by repeated dilution and reconcentration in an Amicon Centriprep-3 and Centricon-3. 500 μl aliquots were then applied to a FPLC ion exchange column (Pharmacia Mono-Q, HR 5/5, 4 cm long, 0.5 cm diameter) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.3 M sodium chloride solution in 20 mM Tris.HCl buffer, pH 7. The elution ran for 15 minutes at a flow rate of 1 ml/minute and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. The eluate fractions were divided into three pools corresponding to 0-0.1 M, 0.1-0.2 M and 0.2-0.3 M sections of the NaCl gradient. EXAMPLE 1A In order to improve yields, certain procedures recited in Example 1 may be changed, as follows: 2. Preparation of the Nominal 0-30 kD Molecular Weight Fraction from Sheep Ovarian Plasma The plasma was cleared by centrifugation at 2000 g, or equivalent for 10 minutes. The cleared plasma (120 ml) was then dispensed into 8× Amicon Centriprep-30 filtration units and centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 10-12 hours at +4° C. The filtrate was harvested at intervals and centrifugation continued until a final volume of 80 ml was obtained. This nominal 0-30 kD fraction was stored overnight in polypropylene tubes at −20° C. 3. Preparation of the Nominal 3-30 kD Molecular Weight Fraction from Sheep Ovarian Plasma The nominal 0-30 kD molecular weight fraction (generated as detailed in 2. above) was dispensed into 6× Amicon Centriprep-3 filtration units and centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 8-10 hours at +4° C. Centrifugation was performed until 2 ml of retentate remained in the outer compartment of each Centriprep-3 unit. The retentate (3-30 kD molecular weight sub fraction) was stored overnight at −20° C. The retentate was subsequently, concentrated to a final volume of 500 μL in an Amicon Centricon-3 unit. After centrifuging the samples at 3000 rpm for 1-2 hours at +4° C., the retentate was placed on ice before applying to the gel filtration column as detailed in 4. below. 4. Preparation of the Nominal 10-20 kD Molecular Weight Sub Fraction from Sheep Ovarian Plasma Samples (2×200 μl) prepared in 3. above were subsequently applied to an FPLC gel filtration column (Pharmacia Superdex-75, HR 10130, 30 cm long, 1 cm diameter) that had been calibrated with protein molecular weight standards. Elution was effected in PBS and fractions (1 ml/tube) were collected over a period of 45 minutes. Fractions falling within the nominal 10-20 kD molecular weight range were pooled and concentrated to 2 ml by centrifugation in a Centriprep-3 unit (1800 rpm for 1-2 hours at +4° C.). The retentate was either stored in polypropylene tubes at −20° C. or used in 5. below. 5. Preparation of Ion Exchange (Sodium Chloride) Fractions from the Nominal 10-20 kD Molecular Weight Sub Fraction of Sheep Ovarian Plasma The concentrated fraction generated in 4. above was subjected to buffer exchange by dilution to 15 ml in 20 mM Tris.HCl buffer, pH 7.6. The Centriprep-3 unit was centrifuged as before for (1800 rpm at +4° C.) 6-8 hours. This fraction was further concentrated to ˜500 μl in Centricon-3 units (3000 rpm for 1-2 hours at +4° C.). Samples (2×200 μl) were then applied to a Vydac&#39;s Protein SAX HPLC ion exchange column (0.75×5 cm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 M sodium chloride in 20 mM Tris.HCl buffer, pH 7.6. Eluted fractions (2 ml/tube) were collected over 45 minutes and activity tested in the rat bioassay (Example 3). EXAMPLE 2 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION Sterile-filtered micrin (5.5 ml; specific activity 1 unit/ml, as described herein) as the 0.1-0.2 M NaCl active ion exchange fraction as described herein and suitably diluted with physiological, pyrogen-free saline, and supplied in a sterile glass vial. The dose (5 ml) can be administered by injection into the peritoneum using a sterile needle. EXAMPLE 3 BIOASSAY Whole plasma and the various fractions of partially purified micrin from Example 1 above were tested by in vivo bioassay as described below Adult female Wistar albino rats eight 200-220 g) or adult male Wistar albino rats (weight 300-400 g) were injected intraperitoneally using sterile needles, 0.5×16 mm, 25 g, with daily 1×1 ml doses of the sheep ovarian venous plasma (or one of the other fractions prepared in Example 1 above) for four days. Ninety-six hours after the commencement of dosing, the rats were then anaesthetised (terminally using carbon dioxide) and the thorax opened surgically. The rats were then partially exsanguinated by cardiac puncture (5 ml); and then each of the rats underwent whole body dissection as described by Hart, Toxicology (1990) 61:185-194.'.\n",
